I've watched this movie many times and its very special.  John Hughes did something very special with this one.  Just trust me it's well worth giving a try 😁

"I saw this film 10 times. Recently every day over and over again as if there are no other films in this world left to see anymore.  Endless, enjoyable and funny beyond believe. To say the least. I'm  giving this films 5 stars for lack of beget option to give it 10.  The play of Michael J. Fox and Kirk Douglas are divine. Love it. Love it. love it. See it enjoy it and please let me know. 😅"
"👏😆 This movie was a lot of fun! While I don't mind superhero movies being dark and serious, it's nice to have something more lighter. The acting was great, especially from the child actors which is important since they were the main focus; plus it's weird seeing the guy who played Korath in the MCU movies to be in this. Also Mark Strong is back playing another DC villain, since he was Sinestro in the Green Lantern movie (which I personally thought was an ok movie), but while he wasn't meant to be a villain in that, he did a great job as Dr. Sivana. The special effects were very impressive, and I love the terrifyingly realistic designs of the 7 Deadly Sins monsters! The story overall is simple but still fun and engaging, but despite it being more of an action comedy, it does have some pretty sad moments that work very well. Honestly this movie feels exactly like it just came out of a comic book or an old Saturday morning cartoon. I just hope that the DCEU keeps the more lighthearted aspects when they bring Shazam into the Justice League. Also Darla is such a cute little ball of adorable sweetness! 😄"

Nothing to write home about. Definitely NOT Oscar material 😂 Tom Cruise brought nothing new to the role.

"It is NOT as special as the original. The music good, but not as memorable as the original soundtrack. The characters were under developed and forgettable…. a tragic waste of magnificent diversity!  This was definitely all about Maverick.<br /><br />Happy! to see Iceman Val Kilmer!<br /><br />Ten dollars ($10.00) would be a better price point, although I am glad I invested so I can rewatch whenever I choose.<br /><br />Bob is adorable! 😍"

Tom Cruise flys planes in real life we learn from this movie more then anything he’s been in before lol. It was cool movie. It didn’t do anything to make me not like it. But it wasn’t so absolutely awesome that a lot of the hype was making it sound like it was. It was cool to feel like you can go back in time and watch a new Top Gun movie with some of the main characters from the first movie 🍿 🎥 Siskel & Ebert woulda gave it 2 thumbs up 👍👍 I’m sure 😉👌😎✈️🛩️

"It was really predictable, and hated that they kept reminding us about the first movie. Plot was boring.<br />Now on the other hand, what I didn't like..my husband loved. Go figure 🙄 BTW.. he'll like any action movie without a plot. 😂"

"How have I not seen this movie before?? Great classic lawyer drama, helmed by Richard Gere in his prime - and really, who can top that..? I'll admit, I'd have watched it just to look at him for 2 hours. Thought I had the twist figured out, but the bank shot at the end got me - and I love to be got. 😉"

Edward Norton outshines Richard Gere in this. It's a good thriller to watch. Good suspense and a twist in the end 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

"I watched the trailer & I thought, ""YESSSSS! A scary, creepy movie!"" That is EXACTLY what I was looking for! I would good the movie a ""6"" on a ""1~10"" scale.

"I don't know if the entire movie is ""God Awful"" as I did not make  it pass the lunatic girlfriend putting the sweet doggy in the microwave, really🤔!!!  I immediately turn this crapy movie in off before she pushed start on microwave 😳!! I did not want that image in my head.  Why would she even bring her dog or leavevt the open, so the doggy could get out.  Why would Billy Zane character leave his cell  phone unlocked for his girlfriend to see if his lover also text him on that phone. None of it made sense to me.  I only  watched the movie in the first place because Billy Zane is  Hiin it....he is one of my favorite actors.  It is a shame as I do normally enjoy movie that star  Billy Zane."

"Excellent film! The suspense was riveting. Julianne Moore, of course is just great ... it's no wonder at all that she's an A list actress. I was delighted to see Jeffrey Demunn (Of 'The Walking Dead' fame, 'The Mist' & other hits). He's a favorite of mine, picks his roles well. Jonathan Rhys Meyers was oh-so-scary & well ... yikes! I also enjoyed the performances of the other actors. Everyone, every single actor & actress gave this movie their all. 6 SOULS is another example of what I like to call &#34;storytelling at its best.&#34; If I could I would change one part in the script ... give the story an alternate outcome. So grab your 🍿 popcorn & enjoy!"

I adore this film. It got audience reviews that said it was too dry and too dark. I think these same reviewers would’ve given the film five stars if it came with a laugh track 😏.

"What the heck did I just watch? Some more weird Illum!nat! crap, but with zero budget? The plot was disjointed at best. The actors had zero talent. The storyline made zero sense. This movie earned exactly zero stars, but Amazon insists on at least one star! 🤦🏻‍♀️  Please, save yourself an hour and your brain cells and just watch something else. Anything. Paint drying. Ants gathering. Water boiling. Literally ANYTHING! You’ve been warned. 🤷🏻‍♀️"

Didn’t get to finish! 😩

"I’m not sure how to review this. As a teenager in the mid 90s, I felt as though this was going to be a little different. While there were some heart-tugging emotional moments (I cried twice), one part in particular actually caused me to recoil in discomfort. I gasped and almost had to look away. Bottom line, I expected this to be more like the 90s I can relate with. My fault for expecting more. It was very artsy and the acting was phenomenal for such a young cast, but overall, it was quite dark and depressing and not in the same awesomeness as Americans Beauty is.<br />More like an Eyes wide Shut, dull, cringe-worthy kind of way.<br />Albeit, not all parts were cringe-worthy, but I was left with a “WTF did I just watch.” And one, “omg, this is not happening.” While it may be good for some, it was not good to me. Maybe because my favorite movie is True Romance. 🤷🏼‍♀️<br />Jonah Hill is brilliant and I can see why the this movie received so many awards, but it hurt to watch. A lot."

"The 80s loved robots… We loved 🥰 The Terminator,Short Circuit,*Batteries Not Included,Short Circuit II … and here's another one!<br /><br />This playful creation-gone-wrong film by a young Wes Craven brings back a wonderful 80s movie  this lifetime horror lover. Just enough zany gore, silly scenarios and a wack-tastic ending to overcome a severely limited budget.<br /><br />A teenager on a university scholarship studying the human brain, young inventor Paul (Matthew Labyorteaux) creates artificial intelligence.(Named B.B)<br /><br />We meet Paul's cute neighbor Samantha (Kristy Swanson; Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and her uber-creepy sweaty abusive dad (Richard Marcus), his creepy old neighbor Elvira (the mean old villainess from The Goonies), and some local punks who get their man-parts squeezed by a protective BB. Speaking of which, BB is super cute but he seems to take note to those who have wronged him.<br /><br />Paul's robot ""BB"" is nothing short of absolutely adorable and he sounds like Disney's Stitch or a Star Wars Jawa. At one point when he was meeting the teenage neighbor boy I think he said ""Houtini."" BB is always getting upgraded and, as a result, smarter. Meanwhile Paul is making decades of scientific progress in mere weeks, already developing the circuitry to jump-start the nervous system of a cadaver.<br /><br />When a prank-gone-wrong creepy Elvira uses her shotgun and blasting BB to robot Heaven, Paul loses B.B.and worse yet, the very night of his first kiss with Samantha, a domestic dispute with her father sends her to the hospital with a fatal injury.  😭<br /><br />So naturally Paul steals Samantha's body, surgically implants BB's ""spare brain"" (a motherboard, basically) into Samantha, and then Weird Science meets Eve of destruction  as he reanimates BB-Sam complete with remote control. Why there is no button to turn his Cyborg-girlfriend into good  droid is beyond me. I guess as a teenage neuro-robotics prodigy he gets plenty of play already.<br /><br />Let's just say that the remote control doesn't work out as effectively as Paul would like, because BB-Sam goes on a killing spree to snuff out everyone who ever wronged BB or Samantha. This in mind, maybe it's a blessing that he didn't go though with the Eve of destruction. Although it would have made for a great death scene! LOL.<br /><br />Director Wes Craven (Scream 4, Deadly Blessing, Cursed) was playful with his low budget-limited few moments of gore. A violent dream sequence has Samantha killing her father and then being doused by his blood as if pouring from a spout,also witnessing  the gory use of a basketball for a detonation-like decapitation. Not to mention the unreasonably stupid but equally super-fun gory surprise ending.<br /><br />He had it coming<br /><br />Hopefully Wes Craven can make a sequel."

"I wouldn't if I were you. It's a rip off. Doesn't contain the whole session. If so,,, why does session two have twice episode as session's one and three combined. I'm asking rhetorically of course, hens the period at the end rather than a question mark. More over: To purchase session two you must buy each episode individually totalling over $200. I've given 2 stars because it's not the video quality I'm disappointed about. Just feel as though I've been burnt is all. And after reading this I'm sure you'll agree it's not worth it. I'd be even more upset if I didn't have an android TV box that I've hacked 😉. I'm posting the very same review for the first season as well. And vice versa."

My two year old loves trains and this made a perfect gift for him to open with his new pj's Christmas Eva and for us all to watch together as a family the night before Christmas. Then he would also get a movie to open Christmas morning for us to all watch while we all ate Christmas morning brakefast. I 100% recommend this movie 😊👍🎄🎅🎁

"I was pleasantly surprised to come across this on Prime.<br />I dont usually take the time to write reviews,<br />but could not allow a 2-star rating to stand.<br /><br />The film is quite surreal but not half as bizarre as many reviews made it out to be.<br />It is not for everyone, but it's not art house film festival challenging either.<br />If you like Gilliam, Lynch or von Trier- you should give it a try.<br /><br />It leaves you with questions at the end, but I found it to have a very cohesive sense of wonder throughout.<br />I think the subtitles were poorly translated, but maybe that oddly phrased English added to atmosphere 😜<br />I also get the feeling that there is mythology that is referenced that I'm unfamiliar with as an American.<br /><br />To sum up, this film felt fresh to me-<br />Neither too predictable, nor non-sensical,<br />The performances and direction create an uneasy, but engaging atmosphere that was worth it alone. 4.5 stars"

I remembered this movie when talking to my boyfriend and I made him sit down to watch this with me. He thought it was the corniest thing ever but it was one of my childhood favs so he doesn't get an opinion 😂

"I saw this.last night with a great, responsive audience that clapped at appropriate moments when Denzel did &#34;Denzel&#34;!  It was a toss up between The Equalizer and another top rated flice and I chose the former.  So glad that I did because Denzel did not disappoint.  This film is nonstop action.  If you liked Train in Day or Man on Fire go see The Equalizer on the big screen with a live audience to enhance the experience.  Denzel was killed by Russians in Training Day.  He gets revenge against them in The Equalizer!  👌🔪💣"

So I have a brand new disc I paid $20 for that I cannot use 🤬.<br />This one works great so I'm ecstatic. If it keeps her happy, I'm happy!  🤣"

The action is so far beyond belief as to make whatever the 'plot was moot.<br />The only way I could make it to the end was to machine gun the 10 second FF button 'til the last shot was fired.In doing so 'movie' was considerably shorter which also helped make it nearly bearable.👎

"The Darkest Minds - It kept me interested from beginning to end to see what happens next! The cast, the storyline . . loved it! Love these type of films that make you think and imagine a whole other world by taking you into the writer's creative stories. I have not read the books but I really enjoyed this movie! To be an orange, blue, yellow or even a green would be so cool. Not sure if I would want to be a red but it wouldn't be at the top of my list at the moment. Loved that this movie had a little bit of everything, truly enjoyed it! And my goodness, the end of this movie 😲🥺 . . . it definitely left me with wanting to see more. There has to be a second one, it'd be a great series!"

"If I could submit a-minus star or two or three that's what I would do. Forest Whitaker horrible. and I like him. I think he's great in all of his other movies, this one? Bad, very very very very bad. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. But that's just me. Although usually,I'm very good at selecting movies/TV series. Because I do not have cable. And if I am buying a  movie or a series, I want to make sure I am going to watch it at least more than 20 times. It may sound ridiculous to most, but believe me, if it's going to be in my collection, it has to be better than just good.  I guess I just made a poor choice with this movie...🙀"

Great movies! An employee told me about these. I wouldn't know about them otherwise. I watched them both online for the first time a long time ago and ended up liking them. I'll watch them again and again; maybe once a month if I can.👍 The theme music in these movies is a favorite of mine as well.

"If you want to watch Madame Bovary then i'd highly reccomend you steer clear of this one and watch the 2000 tv series with Frances O'Connor instead. Like other reviewers said this version of Bovary isn't even remotely similar to the one from the book this Bovary is just straight up nasty the entire time and to be honest I feel like Mia Wasikowska was a bad pick for this. Other then this i've only seen her in the Alice in Wonderland series and in Jane Eyre and from what i've seen she's not a very good actress at least not in my opinion, she acts the same exact way in everything and always has this mean and unpleasant look on her face (and all the characters she's played at least the ones i've seen she's not only mean looking but is mean personality wise too) and i'm not saying she's ugly but she just doesn't have the ""look"" or vibe of a woman from the 1800's if you get what I mean and that probably partly comes down to her bad acting.  Whereas Frances O'Connor is elegant, beautiful, gives off an old world vibe, is a great actress and nailed Bovary (to be honest I love her as an actress all the period pieces i've watched that she's in she did a great job). On the outside not counting the bad Bovary this movie isn't too bad it's so so. The acting isn't all that great at times but the costumes are beautiful and well made and the settings are nice but all that's null and void because of the bad Bovary 🤷🏻‍♀️ Just stick with the 2000 adaptation 👍🏼"

On the outside not counting the bad Bovary this movie isn't too bad it's so so. The acting isn't all that great at times but the costumes are beautiful and well made and the settings are nice but all that's null and void because of the bad Bovary 🤷🏻‍♀️ Just stick with the 2000 adaptation 👍🏼"
"A classic my collection needed. As a relative of mine once said &#34;&#34;Hot girls, sick action, badass CGI; what's not to like?&#34; Can't argue with her on that one. LoL And let's not forget its flippy twisty inny outty deeply profound story and edgy plot. Quick delivery makes it five but I almost made it to four because there is no digital code and the barcode does not scan when trying to digitize it, but it's a throwback so I'll let it slide. 👍"

"I had a huge surprise.I have a 50/50 love hate for Wil Ferrell. Half his movies are unfunny,lacking humor.and the other half O surprisingly enjoyed. This was one I felt bad just the right &#34;I know and feel Wil's pain&#34; especially the &#34;YOUR NOT MY DAD!&#34; Abuse he takes from the kids that he is trying to show he loves and cares for. Just as the kid's start to warm up to his snowflake stepfather persona, in comes the &#34;bad a$$ leather wearing ,look motorcycle dad, fresh out of prison. BOOM there goes the neighborhood! Now stepdad must compete for winning back his respect that he worked so hard for, by showing the kids he is &#34;KOOL&#34; to! Wil makes a fool by showing off and getting hurt, from riding his motorcycle, which he ends up losing control, smashing through his house, to skateboarding . The two dads finally call a truce and become best buds. Mark( paternal father) gives up on trying to win his ex back and finds a new gal, with already made family. They end up getting married, And to his surprise Mark ends up having the same stepdad situation at the end 😱😱"

Don't Breathe is a very cool movie about 3 theives who live in Detroit break in to a man's home only to discover he is more dangerous then they could imagine any fan of horror/thriller movies will enjoy it.<br />👍👍

My husband and I decided one weekend that we make a horror night . So I took him to see the film a lot of buzz in the horror movie magazines like horror hound and horror ville were talking about the new film that director who made evil dead the remake . The film is called don't breathe and I have to say that this film is really good the plot of the story is 3 clever career criminals decide to do the one big job that will make them retire which is 300K in the old house and here is the catch the person they are robbing is a blind man . I know it's really messed up😨 but this not your typical old dude this is the main reason why this movie is so good . The old man they think is so blind and stupid is actually a veteran who skills most him extremely dangerous. The catch is while trying to rob his house home things go wrong and all hell breaks loose and it's true horror Genius.<br /><br />First of all this film is one of the best film is seen in a long time. The performances of the young cast and a powerful and chilling performance by Lang is amazing to watch. The entire film from the moment the criminals arrived in the blind man home to the shocking ending is terrifying film making like the movie the conjuring 2 the film does a brilliant job with cat and mouse chase. There are a lot of scream moments and there is this really sick scene in the film that involves sperms which I will not spoil the film for you let's just say I was grossed out and my husband was like this 😵😖. You will enjoy this film bc it's a scary film that shows how crime doesn't pay but sometimes circumstances happen for a reason . Not saying their actions were right but they were there at the moment at the right time with deadly consequences where the film ends in shocking twist.<br /><br />Now is this movie violent yes it for all you violent junkies who love films that have the guts to show violence and gore this is not a PG13 film . This is a film for hardcore horror fans and you will not be disappointed by the film making . It's not as violent as evil dead but this film performances and horror cat and mouse chases are so good. And this not a Blair witch film where this is a found tape so don't panic. This is a film that looks a true meaning crime doesn't pay with bizarre consequences like something out of a Tarantino film .<br /><br />This film gets a A++++++🎥🎬🎦📹<br /><br />Buy📀 for a penny when it goes really cheap. It's worth every penny to have in your DVD collection.

"I am former military with a pretty high-level of testosterone. This show had been recommended to my wife who really wanted me to check it out wit her. She was quite persistent and finally bribed me to watch the 1st episode. I was reluctant because at first glance, it seemed pretty much a &quot;chick series.&quot; (sorry trying to be sexist pig. Just sayin' it seemed more like a Hallmark or WE series). In truth, both of us lean more toward action and adventure movies &amp; shows.<br /><br />However, once I finally gave in, it wasn't what I expected. You are endeared to the key characters and story-line in the very 1st episode...and after that...well...we were both hooked. In fact, as we have moved forward through the seasons, I’ve been recommending it more and more…though to be honest, when another guy/husband is involved, I still feel I have to qualify it with “listen, I know this sounds like a show for ladies…but just trust me!” 😊<br /><br />Since we are new to the show as of last Fall (of 2017), it has been fun having 10 seasons to sometimes binge watch, and other times, just watch a couple of episodes as a date night or to relax to. The acting and writing is really, really good and the backdrop for the majority of this series (Canadian mountains, valleys &amp; rivers, etc. is breathtaking! In fact, most episodes one of us will go “wow! I’d love to live there!”.<br /><br />Another captivating thing about this series is all the work with horses which is genuine and realistic. Partly because the main character (Amy Fleming) is the real deal in real life when it comes to horses and the great outdoors. In fact, many of the characters are actually quite skilled in real life, which again, comes through in the acting because it’s not forced, but natural.<br /><br />The chemistry between all the characters is natural and never forced. I also feel that the key characters of Ty, Jack &amp; Tim are believable as men, and everyone connects with Jack while cheering Ty on. We can’t recommend this show enough. I feel there is something for everyone. We are hooked, and to be honest, with so much toxic negativity on tv and social media, it is a great mental “escape” for both of us. Another piece for us is, we actually appreciate the level of “modesty” in the series. Meaning, it takes a lot of skill to create a compelling and engaging series that isn’t loaded with sex and agendas. To us, it’s like the comedians that are ridiculously funny without every other word having to the be the “F” bomb (i.e. Jim Gaffigan).<br /><br />For us, this show draws you in with skilled, fun and dramatic writing. It has a believable story line set in the amazing outdoors, and it gives many of us a glimpse into a culture that many of us don’t know exist: the culture of the modern-day rancher/cowboy culture where people still connect face-to-face, everyone pitches in, and if there’s a neighbor in need, people step up to help.<br /><br />Lastly, I feel my wife and I connect with the story line of Amy &amp; Ty. I was 19 and in the military when my wife and I met. She was 21. I proposed with a ring 3 days after we met, and she said yes. We too had a challenging beginning with significant ups &amp; downs, but now, we are 30 years in, deeply in love. So...we have enjoyed the dynamics between Ty &amp; Amy...and so as not to give any spoilers, I'll just leave it at that.<br /><br />Just watch the 1st three episodes of season 1 and decide then. You won’t regret it."

"It is a movie not just for kids. It is so much fun. Before I went to see it I was worried I was going to have some problems because the main character is a Crocodile but it didn't have problems (can't promise everyone with reptile phobias will be ok.. Once I got into his personal and cute they made him no matter what size he was). I fell in love with Lyle's personality and they did soften face character and so funny how he leaps on the magian like a dog and giving him lick kisses like a dog. I love how he connects with people through song and none verbable was to be friends. I love love the movie 🎥 and I give it 5 stars 🌟,  2 thumbs. I am an adult around 40s but kid at heart. I love feel good movies and musicals .... Who ever likes those type movie this should be a movie you will love 💖 ."

"This has to be one of my very favorite comedies. Done brilliantly! The mourning of a loved one is the most difficult time for everyone one time or another. Family is who you count on during that process, unless your this family.<br />This movie is so touching, warm, honest, and tells you not to mourn your loved one but to celebrate the life they lived, even if they were &#34;MEAN & SURLY&#34;<br />Your instantly are drawn to all the members of this family. They warm your heart, you feel what they're feeling, and you watch with a smile & and are laughing endlessly.  When the credits go up, you feel good.<br />Whatever your religious beliefs may or not be, if your white or someone of color, you will find a spirit to this movie, it really will make you feel good. You might even feel differently about that certain family member.<br />You will remember the cast of this movie, because it will leave you feeling better.<br />Get this movie, you won't be sending it back😀"

"I'm ten. I made a huge mistake to watch it. I watched this in my class and it was horrible.Most of the bad reviews are on the DVD not working. I only could watch the beginning. I HATE THIS MOVIE. A Christmas story has TERRIBLE WORDS!!!!!!!!!!!! You think horror movies are nerve wreaking, but the people do things that make me feel beyond terrified and get me to a point of screaming in the movie. First, Raphie's younger brother screams and cries because his mommy puts on too much winter stuff on him and he cries &#34;I can't move my arms!&#34;, and the mom ignores him. My classmates and others found it funny, but that made my tummy sink and I had to keel in order to keep from screaming and throwing up at the same time. I couldn't see the part where a boy sticks his tongue on a wood pole. When I thought it was safe, the bullying started. I hid in the girl's bathroom. I also felt sick when an elf forcefully placed Raphie's younger brother on Santa's lap and Santa scared him by loudly saying &#34;Ho,Ho, Ho.&#34; I had to sit out the rest of the movie. WARNER BROS AND BOB CLARK, HOW DARE YOU MADE A HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!BAD LANGUAGE AND TERRIFYING PARTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Want to know what A Christmas story is for!? ADULTS!!!!!!!!!!NOT FOR KIDS!!!!!!!!!!! BOOOOOO😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😤😤😤😤😠😤😠😤😡😡😡😡😬😬😬😬"

Idk why this movie has so many good reviews. Those reviews are very misleading. It was all over the place and the ending had no substance or closure.<br />It also had an ulterior purpose of this is a result if you don't accept homosexuality😒. Chill with pushing the agenda

"This movie is a lot to absorb. Some of the reviews are helpful, explaining the basis and intricacies of the protagonist and what's going on in her world. One review I think is worthless, where the reviewer is going on about ""multiverse"" and how it's hypothetical 🤣. James Hong, we've all seen that lovable man in many movies. I did not know he was born in Minnesota and was a road engineer here in Los Angeles a short while before acting full time. I watched the movie to the end because I paid for it. I won't be watching it again anytime soon, it just wasn't my kind of entertainment."

"Some of the jokes may come off as confusing or esoteric for some people,  but anyone with a vague concept of dual reality,  and silly high humor that comes off as low humor will appreciate this movie, it just has very dumb irony that ask you to reflect on silly social norms.. as in what if we had hotdogs fingers 🤔  lol watch it to find out, it's just silly and fun."

"I got this Goofy movie because it reminded me of when my oldest son (32yrs old now) was a small kid n this movie came out. The songs was relatable n catchy so u can sing to ALL of them ( which me n my sister did more then the kids 🤣). I enjoyed this movie n wish our kids could go back to movies like this now. What's so crazy is I was strolling through YouTube n the song Stand Out song by Tevin Campbell came on n it reminded me of good funny movies for kids. I also remember the song n sang along to it. I'm hoping as my grandson ( 5 yrs old now) gets older I can share this cartoon movie with him n he enjoy it also. I say buy one to keep just in case you need a laugh or a catchy tune in your head, you will enjoy it either way."

"Keanu is great. But this story line was basic. Maybe there is something I’m missing before the movie release, but the beginning didn’t get you connected with any characters and left a lot to be desired to know more about his dead lover. That’s not a spoiler, the movie started with her in a picture frame. Why do I care ? 👀👀"

"Funny as anything. Watch it! 🤣  Judy, Dora Lee, and Violet keep Mr. Hart busy. Still hilarious after all these years. The opening bars of the theme music are  irresistible. Good, watchable video quality on today's extra large HD tvs for films of this period."

"This is a classic with all the stops. In this movie your going to see the actresses perform a stellar performance together, not to mention their terrible boss gets what he deserves! They don't produce content like they use to 😦"

So glad I got to watch this series!! However I paid for it not knowing I had access to it for free on another streaming channel🤦🏼‍♀️<br />It’s intriguing and different from the other detective shows.

A crazy show of murder mysteries and we are addicted to watching so much so we had to purchase the first season. I felt that it's a little over priced but my wife didn't care so we all know how that works. 😁

Awesome movie still holding up even after all the years. Great Dolby surround sound. Yes I know they take artistic license a bit far (there is $5.00 fine at the real Top Gun for anyone who mentions or quotes the movie) but it is still a fun ride.. 😊

The film stars Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Laura Linney, Andrea Riseborough, and Michael Sheen.<br />The plot follows an art gallery owner as she reads the new novel written by her first husband and begins to see the similarities between it and their former relationship.<br /><br />Ford’s initial challenge with the writing and production of Nocturnal Animals  can be summed up with one single question: how exactly does the experience of a character reading a novel -  I rather rudimentary or pedestrian scenario -  become visually interesting or alluring for audience members?<br />In Nocturnal Animals  is one of the scenes that has been the hardest for cinematographer Seamus McGarvey to shoot -  who, following his work in titles such as  𝑾𝒆 𝑵𝒆𝒆𝒅 𝑻𝒐 𝑻𝒂𝒍𝒌 𝑨𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝑲𝒆𝒗𝒊𝒏 And 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑨𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒈𝒆𝒓𝒔 is no stranger to Insidious forms of psychological Terror or subtly off-putting marksmanship. Depending on the mood and scenery -  whether what is being seen is happening inside of Susan's mind figuratively speaking or outside of her being with optimism or paranoia - Nocturnal Animals  pays special attention to the crispiness of specific colors (in particular, green)  and the orientation of various faces seen on camera. The results are unnerving -  both of the obscure and self-evident variety -  and successfully personify Susan’s fears as she delves deeper into the subject matter of Edward’s writing (which, also includes one  little jump-scare that about killed me, but I have since recovered 😅)<br /><br />Pivotal to Austin Wright’s original premise is the parallels made between Susan's view of the world and how it changes or is it is influenced by her estranged husband’s seemingly innocuous  imposition. The most obviously sound tactic in this regard is the duplicity of Gyllenhaal’s role,  who is cast as both Edward and the lead protagonist of his own novel (Tony).  It's a bit of a hard sale -  despite arguably being an intuitive one -  with Gyllenhaal delivering a well-rounded performance that is divided by variances in temper or sensitivity and the remanence of a passable Southern accent  (which, I bought, like the absolute Jake ladled sucker that I am).<br /> When comparing the potential for Ford’s film to engage with viewers in the same way that Wright does with his readers, however, the gaps between reality and fiction -  where these aforementioned parallels matter the most become glaringly abysmal.  The narrative of Susan's intimate relationships (and, their seemingly inevitability towards failure or deterioration)  is straightforward and made simply a matter of compatibility with little hint of complexity involving Susan's current (but, surprise, also crumbling)  marriage. Opportunities to underscore the loneliness that consumes Susan (that drives her previous experience with infidelity amongst other things) are alluded to with no real insight, and ultimately neglect the one question most pertinent to the source novel as it steers towards revenge:  to what extent is Susan reading into this novel way more than she is meant to be as opposed to being engrossed or disillusioned by its disturbing subject matter?<br /><br />Ford’s screenwriting prioritizes the topic of revenge -  which, on its own is understandable, but the alterations made  as a means to an end are borderline sacrilegious. Susan is written as a pseudo supervillain in terms of what she has done to grievously hurt Edward previously through a bit of a ‘twist’ that is introduced rather abruptly (a twist that isn't in the source novel, mind you) , but the relevancy of it in the grand scheme of things falls short under blotches of ambiguity and points of contention that mostly #oddlyspecific members of the audience may find noteworthy or emotionally compelling<br />( I apologize for seeming evasive, but I'm actively trying to avoid spoilers here)<br /> If things can't get much worse the conclusion of Nocturnal Animals - which is originally written to be cheeky and indicative of Susan's refusal to let Edward have the last word - leaves its protagonist out to dry with little justification for the overall investment in an opportunity for reconciliation (of sorts) that presents itself that viewers are simply left to presume she has an interest in having to begin with.<br /><br />Given its inspiration being subjected to a book-within-a-book like formula, it is only fair that what makes Nocturnal Animals  brilliant also makes it despairingly parenthetical. Ford’s discretion serves to negotiate terms and elements as they will be of a benefit to bookworms and cinephiles alike, but what could be fully  formed loaves are breadcrumbs, and the connection lost and prevented by dissonance is difficult to endorse."

Went to go see it the other day and I left feeling sad but happy. This was a good movie and it had a positive message. Well acted. I did not know Patrick Schwarzenegger acted and he did really well. I also enjoyed Bella Thorne and their onscreen chemistry. Go see it! 😊☀️

I love this movie on a spiritual level okay! I just enjoy watching over and over. I noticed something after the 4th time that I missed on the 2nd time. It’s just a joy to see movies explore everything possible of human capabilities. It a great movie that leaves me feeling like eh “who knows” right? Enjoy 😊

Well once you start to follow deeper into what's taking place as far as pitting one group ways are better when revenge gives way and all Hell breaks loose you begin to melt into through true meaning of what family really means I liked it 4 🌟🌟🌟🌟
This is not what I expected. I thought he was going to actually stay in the house and get footage of what may be there. He spends the ENTIRE movie driving around to different people talking about back story.....disappointing. They mention a gas leak in the beginning of the movie and all the symptoms they have after being in the house for a length of time is surprisingly all the same symptoms from a lack of oxygen...from the gas leak 😂😂😂😂

"Was very disappointed. I was not scared or creeped out at all. The most it did was make me a little curious about the energy coming from the lot. 😐 Gary, Indiana is a really rough area.. so I won’t be visiting any time soon (more afraid of getting shot than I am of what lurks at this house)."

"Zak and Aaron always deliver. Love GA, never mind the haters. This was great! 👻👻👻Wish Zak and the boys would make more full length movies. Maybe even team up with Destination Fear!  I know Dakota was his camera guy, but between the two crew it make for some great teaming of personalities. ✌️"

I gave it 5 stars because these are actually events. After All the horror movies I watched in my life time this was truly disturbing to me because I can feel the the evil in that house. And the stories!! Unbelievable 😱 There definitely Evil Spirits that can travel to your tv. I couldn’t even finished rest of the movie. I left it alone and pray and put gospel music. I rebuke evil at my house (Maybe one day I’ll finish watching it)Just be careful  watching this you never know.

The scariest movie I have ever watched! 🤣 Zak Bagans is the scariest thing on the planet. When he attacked his camera man John I was shaking in my boots. I have never realized witnessing somebody without testosterone could be so terrifying. Then he almost attacked Dr. Taf and held his restraint back. Can we say that it takes a strong man standing in a dark room wearing sunglasses to really fight off some demons. Call me crazy but I think I'm in love!

This is one of my all-time favorite movies I grew up watching bayla Lugosi lawn Chaney Boris Karloff Christopher Lee Peter Cushing and honestly I'm just an old school girl like her old school horror movies creature features and all of that stuff I never get tired of watching these type of movies it's nice to see Lon Chaney play Dracula versus him playing The wolfman which he does both parts really well for that period of time 😁😁👍👍
Yeah Hiii my life story made into a movie 🎥 I wish I was kidding lol actually only 1 part of my story. Stuff goes down tho in psych prisons. Cool movie 🎥 nice soundtrack ♥️

"Better than most people give it credit for. I think if they're planning to do sequels, then they're trying to lay the groundwork with this one. I think Jared Leto' s performance was great. Unfortunately, people keep comparing him to Heath Ledger, which is unfair because he's playing a different type of Joker. The only real problem I had with it is I think they shouldn't have used a &#34;Magical&#34; bad guy  because it's hard to believe that this team would be able to beat something like that. And yes, I realize it's a fantasy. 😊"

And yes, I realize it's a fantasy. 😊"
A must see great casting graey script the best joker ever 👍🏻

"This was the most beautiful movie I have ever seen! Most movies about us gay guys are really tacky and sex filled that I've found on here so far. This reminds me of the fiery passion and PAIN I felt with my best friend when I was in elementary school....knowing your homosexual from second grade on is a struggle! 💯💯💯 I rented this gem but intend on buying and then buying for friends and sending it to them! I hope the director does Hearthstone two and Thor goes to visit his buddy in the city.....fingers crossed....worth the money and reading the subtitles. True to life, I cried and laughed and cried and then sobbed....and then HOPED."
I wish I had never bought this!👎

My husband and I rented this movie from Redbox and decided to buy it. I’m sad to say that when it arrived both the case and dvd were damaged. The packing was perfectly fine but we’re now stuck with a movie we paid over $20 for in total. Really disappointing. 😕

If your family behaves this way you should O’Doyle 🍌 them over a cliff with. Poor dad is abused by his children and treated like crap by the wife.<br />Don’t marry a person who treats you like the wife does her husband in this movie. 1 hour and 39 mins of pain for one second of appreciation to the Dad.<br />Don’t fall for that.

"Thanks to Sylvester Stallone's truly awful take of this movie, this fabulous, edgy, well-acted, beautifully filmed and visually stunning version was unfairly type-casted and neglected by those equating it with the roll-your-eyes cheeseball Stallone version. The two are not even in the same galaxy in likeness. Had it not been, it would have been on par the success of Mad Max, and we'd be enjoying Dredd II and III. This movie rocks, and although it is not perfect, and definitely NOT for kids, it is completely satisfying. Wishing for the sequel 😕"

I found this movie to be not only entertaining but very well performed. The wonders of watching how planes were created. Going back to the Wright Brothers. Faye Dunaway done a brilliant job in her performance as Elaine. Her character was so creative and yet she was so protective of Axel. GREAT JOB FAYE!! Johnny Depp was incredible in this movie as well. Playing Axel was a tough job but in the end very rewarding. Watching him throughout this movie working and trying to make a plane that flys was interesting. Such a cute comedy with lots of twists and turns. Jerry Lewis was terrific and such a sense of humor. Very good job. If you like comedy's and things that's a bit bizarre you will love this. This is a masterpiece!! WAY TO GO EMIR for creating this spectacular film and your creative thinking. 👍👍

"Way back when I was but a wee lad, I first saw this movie and loved it. John Wayne was a legend and everyone's movie idol. For me though, it was Maureen O'Hara I wanted to see. She was my first celebrity crush, with her flaming red hair, bright face, and green eyes. 🥰 As a boy with red hair, and knowing I had at least a little Irish blood in me, I couldn't help but fall in love with her. 🥰💖<br />  All of the characters were such a hoot. The story itself was equally enjoyable and hilarious. Such a gorgeous land looked as if straight from a fairy tale to a boy who grew up in south Texas and Arizona. Sure I loved where I grew up. This land though was so green it almost made the eyes hurt.  Wherever the eyes feel, there were things I'd never seen. Streams everywhere, old bridges, churches, stonework, straw thatched roofs, quaint homes and old buildings; it all infatuating to a desert rat like me. How could beauty, humor, and quirky characters fail to delight? And through it all ran this stunning redhead I loved so.<br /> It was an absolute delight to watch it again. For a little while I forgot I was grown to 60 years of age. Just for a couple of hours, I was again a redheaded boy, not yet ten. 💖"

"There really isn't a whole lot that needs to be said about this movie. This is one of my all time favorite movies, it has been since I was younger, it will be for a very long time after that. Hunter S. Thompson is 1 of my favorite authors, I love almost every book of his that I've read. Also I believe that this movie is made a 100 times better because of Johnny Depp being the lead actor, he plays this role like no one could ever dream of playing and no 1 will ever dream of playing it again. I hope no 1 tries because they would ruin the role and it would be an insult to Hunter S. Thompson himself. Don't care if anyone disagrees with that statement or what the media says about anything that's happened in his past. Man's an excellent actor and hes acting out an excellent part. Enough said! Lol😁🤣"

"Sunday pizza night, we were supposed to go shoot pool but it was heavy snow so we decided movie and a pizza would be a better choice. We had an unforgettable movie night, lots of laughs, in the middle we took a rest break where we theorized what would be happening next, we popped popcorn and got excited for the rest of the movie. I won't spoil anything but the last 20 minutes were and explosion of feelings happiness, excitement, sadness, love, and perseverance. I laughed, cried and truly enjoyed it felt like a love letter to old fans, and an invitation to new fans ""check us out we still got it"" 👨‍👨‍👦❤❤❤ must watch!"

Since COVID we really haven’t felt safe to visit a movie theater so we’re constantly looking to watch movies at home and making it a movie night. So, this is definitely a funny movie entertaining for all ages (well excluding babies 😂). My 4 year old doesn’t really sit still through a movie but this one captured his attention all right.

Hey everyone my husband and I saw steve jobs last weekend just because we had nothing really to do and in watching this movie I learned a few things it's not a full story of steve jobs bc it's 3 product launch and it's not a life and death story of steve jobs so don't go into this movie like it's a lifetime movies so we are not going to learn about steve getting cancer or what he was like in bed . if you want the full story then you need to read the book. I think this story is more for HBO mini series than a movie . you will be disappointed with this movie because this controversial genius has not gotten the respect it deserved . the writer who wrote the social network I thought was going make a really<br />Great movie but I love the social network and the drama behind facebook it was a true masterpiece. This movie was trying to be like the social network and it didn't work.<br /><br />The only interesting part of the movie was what kind of daddy steve jobs was. When you see in the movie it's complexity was very interesting how steve can never be a true father bc of what kind of person he is. Otherwise it's not a great 🎥 to have in your DVD collection. Its more like a rental like you want to see it once and return it the same day...it's not even worth a penny.<br /><br />I don't like to be harsh just honest that even though you have great actors but you can have a full boring movie experience. This was one of them.<br /><br />Don't waste your time to buy this DVD . Michael fassbender is a brilliant actor but his talents were wasted in this movie and Kate Winslet was 👌 nothing amazing . so I give this movie 👎!!!<br /><br />Remember don't waste a penny on a life story that a lazy writer didn't want do the full story.

"I had heard of this wonderful series and did a DA marathon season 1,2 and 3❗ did not disappoint. Characters are well developed and consistent. Historical references are correct as are the costumes and dialect of that time. Simply wonderful! Can't wait for the next season to start🎩"

"What more can I say about Downton Abbey? Downtown is one of the finest series ever put before the world. I say the world because it is seen in over 200 countries. The other awesome thing about it is both men and women like it! Usually it's just the girls; but, it is so well done, so well written, so well presented, so detailed, with the antique cars, the clothes, unbelievable fashions, the hair, the attitudes, the mannerisms, the history, true history, you will love it! Start at Season 1 and watch each one. Do not miss an episode! You'll be bummed when it's over, but you'll enjoy it while it's on! 😆 💐"

"I'm coming to the end of season 4 and all I can say is, it keeps getting better and better. It's a show that should never go off the air. Just perfection.....<br />I'm saddened that there's only season 5 left and that it's actually running on TV now.<br />Please let them never end this amazing series . 😀"

I've been told about this movie and I'm so glad I've finally been able to watch it. As a black woman there are many facts in this movie that I wasn't aware because they don't teach black history in school. Now I can go & research some of these for myself. Because we have not learned from our history is the reason we're still repeating it. Some of the reviews here are very hateful & that's why we can not heal & move forward as a human race. It's sad in 2020 so many people are still screaming hate because of the color of ones skin.😔

"Is this a joke? If so, a bad one. Fighting racism with more racism and bigoted hatred is ironic to say the least.<br />The film tries to connect historic racial injustice with some facade of current racial narrative. It is inaccurate and pandering to a bs leftist cause. If you swallow this tripe, then you are no better than lambs being led to the slaughter. Read some statistics and think critically people. Is this what the American psyche has become? Omg. So sad 😔"

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!<br />This movie is HORRIBLE! The acting is like watching Ben Stein give a review on growing grass and the low budget effects are ridiculous.<br />Seriously...pass this one up.<br />I want my money back. 😡

"I watched this movie with my teen daughters and pointed at what not to do and lectured them about not doing things they aren’t comfortable doing, as well as not talking or meeting up with people off the internet as you don’t know who that person is or their intentions!  They asked me to watch this movie with them lol but I turned parts of it into a lecture and a good lesson 😁"

"Horrible!  It claims “based on true events” or “actual police footage” all FALSE!  The “actual police footage” has the actors in it 👎🏽.  The whole thing is horrible; acting, events, storyline!! Just an excuse for teen porn for the same predators this file was “trying to expose”.  I think the entire message can be delivered with better taste and class!  If your teen watches, (of course) watch with them only to discuss “the message” but besides that Please don’t waste you time or hard earned $2.00!"

I love the movie!  I own the original DVD 📀.  I figured why not get the blue ray bc I have a vast movie collection.  This copy is an embarrassment and an insult.  I am forced to watch this version with most of the screen cut off...my tv is 70”.  I should be able to turn this off but there are no options and no closed captioning.  Ridiculous.  I’m glad it was so cheap or I’d be returning this.

"What a great storyline … of course you have to see the first one😊<br />They’re both heartwarming and you fall in love with all the characters … each one attempting to fit in or settle into “late life” transitions. Some want to find purpose, a mate, or simply be there for others. It’s funny how many generations intertwine in this movie and mesh perfectly to help one another - so beautiful!"

Wished I had had purchased the movie instead of just renting it. It would be awesome to have the option to add the extra ten dollars toward purchase if you like the movie. If you like the &#34;Taken&#34; movies you will love this one. This is a kickass movie and I'm ready to watch it again!!! And again😀 I do not know how someone could NOT enjoy this movie. Keeps your attention throughout. Badass movie..just buy it!!!

A Mel Brooks classic! I will never get tired of this comedy. SO many good one-liners and references. Not to mention Cary Elwes in his prime is pretty easy on the eyes! 😉

Not going to lie. I bought this movie just to watch Helen Slater climb out of that pond over and over again. 💘

I love this show...I watch all 6 seasons once a year. When I sew I put it now and am a happy camper.it saddened me when they canceled it. This is my Kentucky Family..we visit for as long as it takes..you would think they would behave themselves better..but it's the same each time...lol.. Did I tell you I really love this show?..😊

Layed  up with an injury.  I was getting pretty bored started looking around on Amazon  decided to try justified. Totally feel in love with Raylen!<br />Have gone through all 4 seasons  and 1/2 way through 5 in a matter of a few weeks. Sad I only have one more left😢<br />Love all the marshals enjoy Art & Raylen's relationship. Some of Harlen's citizens can get annoying but you gotta love Boyd. And poor Ava even though she is pretty ruthless still feel sorry for her.

"What's not to love (except the graphic violence😣)? From the seamless storyline carried over episode to episode, the fully developed characters, the flawed leading men and women and the dark humor, this is right up there with my all-time favorite series."

"I used to have the Canadian Collector's Edition but I ended up losing that one, this has all of the Special Features as that one plus some newer ones as well. This copy comes with both a Blu ray disc and a DVD disc both with all the identical Special Features shown in the picture I posted. This version is the definitive edition of this movie, I've liked this movie for the past 20 years when I first saw it as a kid in middle school, it hit the nail on the head and was such an underdog movie compared to bigger production movies like Idle Hands and Urban Legend. This movie will always have a special place in my heart and has been on my top 5 favorite movies list since I first saw it all that time ago. It's a good price for all that comes with it. Buy it, you won't regret it 🎃"

"Very funny! The movie could have done without the display of rape performed by Sacha Cohen torward Will Ferrell. Made absolutely no point in the movie besides the expression of having a man kiss another man.. if they would have formed a relationship where they had to CO-parent the boys and then Talladega night 2 comes out were the youngest gets a sex change because he, or she now, is not getting the same attention or love as her brother. So she marries Danica Patrick and they ask Will Ferrell if they.... to know how Talladega Nights 2 ends you will have find my next post somewhere in Amazon prime... or have some movie guy reach out to me on IG@ Northside_R1 and we will make a movie! 😜"

"I LOVE this movie! If you liked Deadpool, you will love Deadpool 2. It is hilarious! I’ve watched it like 10 times... Ryan Reynolds’ quick and witty banter with other characters is beyond funny... it’s inappropriate, sometimes cringy but ALWAYS side splittingly funny! It’s NOT for kids, though I teach 4th grade and MOST have seen it. I have to pretend I haven’t in order to maintain their delusions that teachers  are serious and just don’t get it! 😂😂😂<br />I would also recommend Once Upon a Deadpool... which is THIS movie with Fred Savage kidnapped by Ryan Reynolds and forced to listen to the story Princes Bride style!"

"If I’m having a rough day, I can always rely on Spider-Man to help me out. No matter the universe we travel to with spidey, he effortlessly swings into action and grasps the attention of my son quicker then Harry wanting revenge. 🙌🏻 After traveling the full multiverse with my son, we are most definitely ready for a tear in the space time continuum. Thank you Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, and of course the OG himself, Tobey Maguire. 👏🏻"

Now as someone who loves Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield, Spider-Man<br /> This movie is great 👍 I would recommend this to anyone who loves spider man or the Marvel cinematic universe in general!"

Um if u haven’t seen it I won’t ruin it. But this is me at the end 🤦🏻‍♀️🥴😭🥺😩😡😭. I’m so glad it’s coming back for a season two cuz I love Theo James. Just hate that as far as getting good movies and scripts the only one I have seen him in that was just him was Archive. But I did like him in Lying and Stealing too. Playing Sindey is just one more role that shows his diversity.

Harrison Ford was a surprise! I loved the way he put his wife of 40 years at ease regarding his love for her! I looked over at my husband during that scene!! Lol😁"

"[Arrived Saturday, March, 3, 2018]  I’m watching it right now😀😀<br /><br />I’ve seen this movie several times, now I own it!!  I loved going to my summer camp (1st week was for diasbled teens, like me; 2nd week was for non disabled teens) plus we had nice and cute camp counselors and food was good too!! I still even have my pictures I took back then; loved it all 😀😀"

"The movie itself is hilarious. No question about it. And those adolescents who believe it's not so, they must return to their Micky mouse cartoons. This movie is too much for them to understand.<br /><br />When I received the movie, immediately started watching it. At 17:23 time stamp I notices that a significant segment of the movie is missing. That's the episode when the new boss of the chemical plant (Bobby Pellit) ordered the plant manager (Ken) to trim the fat (fire Hank on the wheelchair and the healthy woman). Right after revoking the handicap privilege from Hank the scene jumps right onto the dental office, whereas the part should continue to the segments where the plant manager tells Hank on the wheelchair that he's being terminated from the employment. This part is about 15 minutes in length.<br /><br />Followed by disappointment, I've processed the return for an exchange with another one thinking that it might be a sheer accidental missing part. But wouldn't you know? It turned out to be a defaulted defect in recording, because the new one I've received had exact  the same problem, missing a part from the movie.<br /><br />I've retuned the second dvd as well and scheduled my DVR to record the subject movie then I'll transfer it onto a dvd. I'd prefer the good movie as such to be on an original dvd.<br /><br />Horrible Bosses, This is 40, Identity Theft are similarly sharing the same best. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍👍👍👍👍<br />And please if you haven't yet exited your adolescence, stick to game boys and cartoons such as ""Micky mouse"" and ""Nu Pogady""<br />👊👊👊 I know you Star Treks and Superman, your flying saucers never reach your dreams in real life. So Keep fantasizing in your dreams to entertain yourselves in the worlds of fantasy. Hehehehe"

I play this for my foster kittens.  They really love it.  They sit in their tower and watch it from start to finish. Too cute.  4 out of 5 stars because when you watch it as a human there's a few very sad bits that I just don't think were necessary.  😪

"My family and I could watched this over and over again on my iPad.  The MOVIE was GREAT 😊 However, when I called Prime to help me add the app on my smart Tv as it suggested, They wanted to charge me. When I asked to speak to a supervisor regarding the charged to add, they said the supervisor was busy, so I asked for the Supervisor Supervisor they put me on hold and hung up.  Not to mention the Representative had real Bad broken English. I have been warning my family and friends who want to get Prime to really watch out. I personally cancel my subscription."

"This is the best transfer currently available on blu ray by far.. The colors and resolution are great.. The bonus footage is good with a really cool interview with Roy Horan and exclusive opening sequences from The UK and Japan.. The new Artwork by Kung Fu Obrien sold me on it too but a big disappointment about this particular disc is the missing interview by Hwang Jang Lee about the film which was promised for this release. This is the reason the disc gets only a 4 star. We are paying another $35 for some bonus footage and a small poster.. Lets get that Hwang Jang Lee interview on the next one and make it a complete 5 🌟<br />Overall, If this is your first blu ray of the title it will be a treat. Im gonna chill with this one til I hear of one much better.<br />."
"Love A.Y.A.O.T.D.!! I was elated to see amazon offer this series! I enjoy introducing my six children to the shoes I grew up watching, and this tops the cake! SNICK at nite was one of our fave nights in my home. Now my children are falling in love with the creepy, fun stories just as I did. Thank you amazon! Now let's get the other SNICK line ups! 😁"

"When I first saw this movie in 2019, I fell in love with it! The story is sweet & has a nice message about what friendship is, and the vocal cast are terrific.  There are some action scenes that may or may not scare small children, but overall, is action-packed & humorous. The animation really wowed me, especially the scenes with snow & ice. I am so sorry that all the Disney movies take all the glory away from these other animation studios, because there is so much talent besides the mouse house. (On a side note: did ""Toy Story 4"" really deserve the Oscar over ""Missing Link""? I say No. Even ""How to Train Your Dragon - Hidden World""  was better, but that's just my opinion.) I am very happy to add this movie to my collection, and I know I will continue to enjoy for years to come. 😃"

When this item arrived I heard the DVD sliding all around in the case. I opened it to find the case was broken so the dvd was sliding all around. The dvd was very scratched and skipped in multiple parts. Had to go out and buy another one 😕

"This review is about the item and the seller. Nothing on the listing indicates that the DVD is formatted to country code 0... I had to look that up when the error came on the screen. USA is country code 1. The seller appears as two different people. Goodwill of Colorado was probably just trying to make a buck on some donated items because I hope they didn't buy these in bulk. It looks like MANY other people got foreign DVDs as well. Just like DVD, Blu-ray, the country code needs to be included on listings. I understand buyer beware but this is ridiculous. 😡"

Great movie to watch with kids.  This movie is what makes me cautious around the sewer connections.  Also makes me concerned about renting RVs.  Who knows what hoses are connected to what.  😖
Good Robin Williams film. We laughed ourselves silly 😄Our poor dog was wondering what was up. I highly recommend it.

"Where do I start...I saw this in theaters alone because there are Tom Cruise people and there's everybody else, let's be honest. This film though...take that and throw it out. This is a sleek, engaging film, with some surprisingly original concepts as far as film goes. I thouroughly enjoyed it and loved the ride, also a lot of great supporting actors (Bill Paxton for one he's only one of the original actors from another great film in the same vein, nice nod) Top 10 favorite scifi films in my book...and I say to people who have no desire to see it, &#34;Tom cruise dies in it 😏&#34;"

"This had the potential and the star power (Cavill, Kingsley, Tucci, etc) to be a really good movie. Once again the description misleads, which isn't detrimental for the plot twist.<br /><br />First half drags a little bit, but gives enough to keep you interested. They could have fleshed it out more with backstories, couple of which you don't get till the end.<br /><br />I'm a detail person so a little backstory on why the cop (Cavill) and the judge (Kingsley), who have no prior association in America (they referenced state instead of province) both had British accents would have been nice. Story could have been based in Canada, which the accents would be common. CHOICES!<br /><br />Couple of other things but they could be seen as spoilers.... Overall a good piece of entertainment!<br /><br />And looking at Cavill for hour an a half doesn't hurt! 🤣"

This is a well put together film maintaining suspenseful scenes with a slow reveal. My favorite scene is in the courtroom with closing statements. The emotional connection with viewer is maintained even having to read subtitles for the entirety of the movie.<br /> I enjoy Korean films and TV shows. This will be added to my list of suggested films!<br />I love Jung-Woo Ha acting and ability to evoke emotion and gain the attention of his audience. He is also easy on the eyes 💕

"This was a Wonderful surprise to have found this rare movie 🎥 and on Amazon. It’s one of my 12 yr old granddaughter’s Favorite movies. Yesterday was my birthday (11/10/1964) After my birthday 🥳 🎂 get together, it was time to slow down and start getting ready for bed (I live with my daughter & her family) so I asked her if she was tired  yet (it was already 11:30pm) & she said no, so I asked her is she wanted to watch a movie and for her to pick one. She unfortunately couldn’t fully remember the name of this specific one, but I told her let’s try anyways & see if we could find it with what she could remember of the title. Low and behold, bingo here it was on Amazon 🥳🎉🥳🎉🥳 WooHoo, so I rented it and she was soooooooo Happy 🥰🥰🥰 So she came and cuddle up with her grandma and we watched her movie. These are the times I will Cherish forever. No matter how old my grandchildren get. So Thank you Amazon Prime 🥰😘🥰😘🥰😘you made this grandmothers Birthday even better 🥰👏🏼🥰👏🏼🥰👏🏼🥰👏🏼"

"The only difference this movie and collegehumor video is Diego isn't gay and no guns. They still kept the theme that Dora is crazy and hasn't mentally grown-up, so it's enjoyable for adults. It's pro-home schooling and being yourself. The ending was high school musical 😂🤣"

"A complete work of cinematic fancy, to the point of stupidity. Devoid of virtually all historical fact, legal precedent, international law and jurisdiction. To say that this movie was “inspired” by a book is like saying that ET was inspired by our landing on the moon. Good costumes and period settings, but otherwise 90+% fictional. 🤔🥴"

"Almost gave it a three because the plot is deep in a way. Not that it makes any sense. It was hard watching them brutalize her in the end, and for what? It was very well directed, the cinematography was excellent and the acting was excellent, but I was left wondering what for? I read many glowing reviews before I rented the film. I don't get anything deep or worth all the terrible misery. The film leaves me feeling empty and sad at best. 💩💩💩 I give it 3 poops"

This was my first &#34;Non-Disney&#34; movie that I saw at 10 years old. My mother took me to see it at the local theater and people were actually SCREAMING when the wave hit the ship!!! I loved it then and still watch it on DVD every New Year's Eve. I am recently married to. A younger man who is from Africa and he was not seen it yet so we may have to watch it together before 12/31 😇

"I'm surprised at the people who said that they wasted two hours of their time watching this. I wasted a mere 5 minutes before I turned it off and headed over to read the reviews (just in case I was wrong). I won't make that mistake again; reviews will come first next time.  Rule of thumb:  if Hollywood likes it, shun it at costs!  Speaking of cost, I did waste $2 in digital credit on this movie.  👎"

"This movie makes Christians look bad the entire time... I can now see Benicio Del Toro hates God. Good luck with that Benicio sir...<br />And the same goes to all those who participated in making this ""God hating macabre"" movie, and those whom applaud it as well. Just plainly put- a sick and twisted movie, that also encourages to hate God, and His people.  Truly just sickening, not at all any talent in it- just simply ignorant, and VULGAR!  😫"

I wanted to like this movie. The premise was intriguing. However the actuality was disappointing.<br />The graphic violence and sexual content were done for naught.<br />Sad because it would of been a enjoyable movie with a more delicate touch.<br />👎🏼👎🏼

"My review may be biased for I’m a fan of Dough Jones and Guillermo del Toro. It’s got an excellent cast. ‧˚₊*̥(* ⁰̷̴͈꒨⁰̷̴͈)‧˚₊*̥ Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon too. (*’∀’人)♡ I’m not good at remembering actors names (anime and international preferences) except, those that take me and bring a film to life before my eyes. So yeah, it was amazing this actors were all in one spot! Seriously, Richard Jenkins! Wow!! And David Hewlett from favorite sci-fi shows and movies. Wowed 💗 This was one “Beauty and the Beast” that had me in tears the very end. Couldn’t stop after from joy. The best way to put it, it’s a fairy tale with the monster of the blue lagoon. A movie I watched in the 80’s in Cuba as a child on tv. Never forgotten. The Shape of Water was classy, elegantly done, it was like a 1940’s or 50’s flick on HD! Yeah, my 13 year old DID turn his head at the nudity. What got his and my 16 year old sons, was the music score. 🎼 Since they’re into video gaming, the 1940’s sound was an arrow through the heart (mine too)! That’s one I’ll be getting next paycheck. (I couldn’t convince them to wait until I said okay). Already got the book and Audible. I hated not all theaters were playing it. Glad, because I’d be embarrassed walking out with teary eyes, runny nose and a smile from ear to ear!! 🙄 Got it on digital video out of one click happiness. Definitely will be a collection at home!! ❤️ 💕"

"this movie wanted to be good but it just pandered a little too hard. it's like ... i get it ... everyone deserves to be loved. bad guys are bad. good guys are good. cinematographically beautiful, but otherwise basic af. this was like... insultingly devoid of nuance or complexity. if this had been a children's fable, fine. if it had been a fantasy geared toward adults... maybe fine. But it was some weird childish masturbatory hybrid with no ground-breaking themes to speak of. wait, wait. bestiality is pretty ground-breaking. so i take it back; with one disturbing-but-still-touching-in-a-way-that-makes-you-feel-uncomfortable-and-wonder-if-it's-okay-to-maybe-bone-your-exceptionally-intelligent-pet-if-it's-human-y ground-breaking way to speak of. 🤔"

"I actually am chuckling as I write this.  This movie is so dumb it's funny.  And what cracks me up the most is that Hollywood actually liked it  & thought it merited awards!  How terribly funny and how terribly ridiculous all at the same time.  Before spending the $9 bucks on this thing, I did read the bad reviews and ""thought"" they sounded like they were simply written by ultra-conservative, ultra-religious people so decided to chance it.  FYI, if you read those reviews too, other than the lead actress appearing nude several times, the only graphic sex was between the villain and his wife.  Everything else is implied.  HOWEVER the gratuitous VIOLENCE is another story!  It was just down right gross.  Who wants to watch scenes about cut off fingers and then when they are reattached, them turning gangrenous?  I can't speak to the scene with the cat, I knew about it and so skipped that part, but I will say the creature seemed really penitent afterwards.  (Oh my gosh, I'm laughing again!) AND, speaking of skipping ahead, I did that A LOT.  Some parts with the ""villain(s)"" just got so monotonous and boring it was ridiculous.  And as for any hopes you might have for good special effects & costuming, don't get your hopes up.  I think the creature simply had on print tights, LOL!  (ALTHOUGH, there were some kinda cool blue LED lights in his body armor I guess. (STILL laughing as I type.)) What a joke of a movie this was and what a waste of nine bucks!  Oh well, I knew better and yet did it anyway.  (NEVER go by what Hollywood thinks is a good movie, LISTEN to other reviewers!  Hollywood just likes to pat each other on the back and is so out of touch with their audience, they wouldn't know a good movie from a ""lizard in a bathtub""! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"

"I haven't even seen it. Dont need to. I can tell from the reviews this is not a balanced doc at all. Amazon should avoid bieng so irresponsible and remove this. Oh by the way, nothing in life is 💯 Percent safe. Not an aspirin, or Tylenol or a vaccine. It's a risk Vs risk thing. I'd rather take the tiny risk of a side effect ( not autism btw, that's not  one of the side effects) then inevitable risk of major fatal childhood diseases getting a foothold in our society again. Big pharma? I hope all people who make that statement never, ever need a doctor for anything ever. Or you will be "" feeding the big pharma machine'.  please. More BS here I can tell. I'll pass."

"Absolute classic of a movie.  It was rumored they might remove all scenes & references to The World Trade Center after 9/11 but thankfully they did not.  I'd avoid the sequel Escape From LA or atleast stream or borrow it.  Now if they'd do a ""Escape From DC"", that might be worth seeing!😀"

"I would have given it a lower rating if possible. We thought from the title and preview, we would be watching a scientific documentary about fungi. Instead we got a mismash of politico-socio propaganda, a cheer rally for psychedelics (they are the reason we have human intelligence😂), and pseudo science to the nth degree. Perhaps this came to life as a taxpayer funded film for the family member of a well to do Ivy League clan who needed to throw a bone to the one who didn’t quite measure up? Anyhow I’d like my money back, but more importantly those minutes of my life just wasted."

"As always these actors are amazing. A window into this couples choices of career, art and relationship. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and am old enough to feel the sting of being disregarded as just female and being stuck in a sexist role. “Are you taking good care of him?” because of course the man must be the treasure in it all 😜"

THEN you'll see WHY ppl HATE BANANAS!. Hope he never wins anything again! Also-LOVE CARA!( doesn't she look like Allysa Milano)? Victor from BB! Yay! Loved him! Saffy (me) has LOTS to say! Miss CT also.I really hope Sarah returns as she's one of the Very BEST competitors! Please come BACK SARAH!"

Very disappointed to see this version has a stupid ending. I wanted the version with the happy ending. I hate this and I wish I could switch it for the other one. It should have said this has a different ending!🤨

"I was looking for just one of these movies but it was cheaper to get this 6 pack than to buy it individually, which is a great bonus. The DVDs came new, just like from a store. No issues with skipping or it not playing. They have 2 movies per DVD. The only odd thing is that they have all 3 DVDs stacked on one another instead of having an insert that you can flip like I've seen with other mulit-DVD cases. I will probably remove 2 of them and put them in their own case to reduce the chance of scratches. Other than that 👍👍 I have no complaints."

Easily one of my favorite shows 😀
Love Suits  soooo much the fashions are so great for the women in the cast and love the great ties all the men wear and most of all love all the actors so much  should have won some Emmys😘😘😘😘😘
Hate that you make me wait or pay to see the next season shame on you😩
I had never seen it before but the title was intriguing so I thought I would give it the 15 minute test. Before I realized it it had drawn me in and I wanted to continue watching to the end.  I can't wait to watch the next episode. 😊
I 💖 This show! Always keeps the audience guessing
Seriously addicted to this show!!! Love it more than chocolate cake with a side of vanilla ice cream -- so that says a lot. 😉
Love it! Too bad season 6 isn't free. 😔
I have binge watched all 5 seasons in about a month.  Love this show.  Can't decide if I love Lewis or hate him!!!  Good actor.  Good writing.  Also have a huge crush on Harvey.  😉
This is my FAVORITE SHOW! So happy Amazon has it free to watch for Prime members! Just another reason for me to renew my membership! 😊😊😊
It's new favorite obsession! 😍
I can't wait to watch season 6 🙌🏾
It's just so sooooo terrible & not even in a funny enough way to be slightly worth it 😜

"I hate when people argue that something isn’t a carbon copy of the original. A. why spend millions on a copy and B. Go watch the original one then! 🙄 This movie is really good, actually IMO better! It also never said it was a remake of the cartoon. It is a live action movie of the tale of Mulan. Mulan, an actual folklore, nothing to do with the cartoon Mulan.<br /><br />The aesthetics are beautiful, the acting is flawless, and overall a very enjoyable movie. I think this also may be the first Disney movie without singing (thankfully). To the naysayers, watch the original! 🙄 Giving this treasure low ratings because people cannot read that it is not a remake."

There is some bad words but it is PG-13 so it's a good rating. There is a part where Kong ripped out a monsters toung. There's some blood so if you don't want your child to see blood then do not watch King Kong.😇

The lead *Protagonist is great! Check out his previous work in other films! This film gives some detail about the actual *Background/Origin of this Vampire unlike the original film. It displays modern-day movie magic/CGI for villain & hero action and done tastefully. The *Script did away with the traditional Vampire backdrops & creature habits... ooh.. so exciting writing this! 😊 The make-up is stellar!

"This was a terrible movie First off....you have Dean Cain you give him 3 lines at the end of the movie! 2. The bridge in the movie is a true laughable one if anyone has ever seen our real New River Gorge Bridge you will know it is a huge 4 lane bridge with concrete barrier in the middle and you do not see houses on either side 🤦‍♀️ 3. This was just a stupid idiotic movie I watched it so that I could just see how stupid it could actually be!!!! Now with all that being said let’s hope that people doesn’t get the idea of committing sucide from the bridge is so popular that everyone rushes to do it we have enough of that already so peace out and let’s make better choices when making and watching movies!  If I could have given this below a one star I would have ! And yes I live in Fayetteville,West Virginia!"

"Wow.  If you want to watch a movie steeped in ignorance and negative stigma against behavioral health, this  horrendous movie is for you!  Premise: If you are depressed, a veteran, hopeless, use medicine for pain, are homeless, experienced trauma, steal, or are even just vulnerable you’ll become possessed and kill yourself by jumping off of this bridge in WV. I mean the messages in this movie are to the point of irresponsibility.  People actually FUNDED this movie?🤯"

"Excellent film, and one of the best of the vampire genre I've ever seen (and I've seen many). The mood Neil Jordan set was perfect for the film. The actors were all great (except for Pitt IMO). Even those in smaller roles (the victims) gave excellent performances. Tom Cruise's Lestat was the standout performance bar none, and held the film together (this guy was the perfect choice). Lestat ENJOYS being a vampire, and his antics and attitude make the film interesting and worth watching. Problem is he disappears for about 45 minutes or so after the first hour. Brad Pitt is a poor actor (in IMO only) and when Cruise disappears I found myself missing the perfection in which he played Lestat. He re-appears once again in the last 10 minutes or so, and even then, you are reminded just how much his presence was missed overall. Cruise knocked it out of the park with Lestat. Well worth watching . 👍"

"I bought this to add to my online collection, since I had it on DVD before. It's such a feel good movie, & I've always thought Paul Rudd was so adorable. 😉<br /><br /> The entire cast is great, Steve Coogan, Adam Scott, Zooey Deschanel, Emily Mortimer, Rashida Jones & Elizabeth Banks. They all mesh perfectly for the story of a naive, lovable guy who believes if he sends out positivity to the universe, the universe will send it right back! (Even if his three sisters are crazy!)<br /><br />One is the control freak, image conscious, snarky writer for Vanity Fare magazine. Another is the open, free spirit who models nude for artists, & calls herself ""the dumb slutty one."" The other is a politically correct, environmentally friendly, stay at home mom of two whose selfish, trust fund husband calls her ""meek & mousy.""<br /><br />Ned gets out of prison after 8 months, where he was ""most cooperative inmate of the month three months running""! He's just ""an organic farmer who made a mistake""! (Selling weed to a uniformed small town cop at the farmer's market because the cop told him he was having a hard week & really needed it & Ned truly felt sorry for him!)<br /><br />After prison, he goes home to find his hippy pacifist girlfriend has already replaced him on the farm with another guy remarkably similar! So begins his saga of rotating through each of his sisters' abodes & personal lives, wreaking total havoc like a huge, gangly, good naturedly oblivious puppy! (Liz talking to Miranda & Natalie: ""can't one of you take him!?"" haha)<br /><br />There are just so many lol moments, hilarious family & interpersonal dynamics, & innocent total truth telling, that just do yourself a favor & WATCH THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />The music is great too, from Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Old Oak Tree, to Willie Nelson songs, & my favorite acoustic at the end sung in a modern/folksy kinda way about ""wherever I go, I'm taking you with me, wherever I go, you're coming along.""<br /><br />You'll wish you had an ""idiot brother"" by movie's end."

"Such an underrated movie. If you ever want to see what it’s like in the mind of a musician/composer, this is your movie. Witty, funny and pure creative genius. The cast is amazing, the storyline is not cliche and it keeps you interested throughout the whole storyline. Out of 10, I’d give this movie a 💯."

"I have 1 word to describe this movie. That word is “wow!” I do not have any ultra-HD devices (that I know of); but, I did not need that. The message within the movie is powerful enough. I felt that I could relate to a decent amount of it. I could not stop feeling bad for Charlie Brown and Pig-Pen. Charlie Brown’s life represents the common “Why me?” or “Why always me?” feelings. The red-haired girl reminds us about how we have worth that far exceeds what we see. Although our sense of self-worth might feel “in the dumps” or “in the toilet,” our worth to others generally goes unnoticed. Although the timing of my order was not when I intended it, I am glad that it happened, even if only by accident. It was what we, as humankind, perceive as “an accident.” But, despite some words that I do not care so much for (notably a word beginning with R, ending with L, and containing the common abbreviation for Electronic Arts sandwiched between them), the message was quite touching for me. I do strongly encourage the watching of this movie and will give a warning that it is a tearjerker (especially when Charlie Brown does talk with the little red-haired girl). I teared up during that. This movie deserves a quantity of stars that, if stacked, reached to the stars. 🤣 Oh, with regard to Pig-Pen (as I mentioned him, but went no further, oops), he reminds me of Casper the Friendly Ghost. He simply desires to have friends and be friendly to people; but, some others do not desire to be around him because he smells bad. This is similar to how most people are scared away by Casper’s presence simply because he is a ghost. The girl who wanted to dance with Pig-Pen is also a reminder of our oft unseen worth to other people."

This movie was watched by my whole family. It was so informative about so many aspects of what the government has been lying about for 70 years. Dave Paulides doesn’t assert any opinions which is refreshing but allows the viewer to take the facts and make their own opinions on what is happening.<br />I think this is one of the most valuable pieces of investigation being done along with the investigative reporting of Linda Moulton Howe and cattle mutilations. Awesome 👍

"We've been introducing the classics to our daughter for years...Ray Harryhausen, Alfred Hitchcock films...Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Abbott & Costello..you name it! But after watching The Princess Bride for the Millionth time (haha) we were talking about how the man who trained & created the swordfights was the same guy who trained Errol Flynn & Tyrone Power which led to looking at our movie collections & discovering...Oh No! We neglected to add some of the greatest Pirate films of allll time! Which is when we purchased this, among others! Tyrone Power was my mom's &#34;crush&#34; when I was a little girl (uhhh...you know, not so long ago! 😁) Anyhoo....this is simply an amazing movie! The quality of film on blu ray is so great! The clarity & color of the sets & costuming is rich. Our daughter LOVED this movie and said she can't wait to share yet another timeless classic with all her film buff friends! We've started a classic film revolution with this generation! So good to see too...enjoying quality films with fun-loving stories or intricately woven mysteries & masters of suspense!! Awww the &#34;good old golden days of Hollywood!&#34; This is definitely a Must Own for any lover of the classic pirate genre!"

"This was a profound and compelling portrayal of the climate and intolerance of the sixties.  It is perplexing that human beings can't get along and live in peace.  Sadly, the same intolerance that was displayed then is happening to people of all races and creeds.  😢"

"There is a reason that this show is our favorite. These guys have showed us REAL proof of the paranormal right from the start. This documentary has some of the BEST evidence that I've ever seen. We've been watching Ghost Adventures for years, seen every episode, but had necer seen this. Until now. I am still amazed. I would give anything to get to hang out with these guys.<br />The video was delivered in the exact time as expected. It was in perfect, brand new condition, sealed in plastic wrap as it would be in the store. No complaints whatsoever from this buyer. 🙌💯👍👏"

"A very important topic. A very powerful movie. Outstanding performances by both Susan and Sean (wish he got the Academy award for this role). One of the stories that makes you ponder who is to decide who is going to live and how much punishment one deserves? A movie questioning your values, beliefs and the capital punishment.<br />The only disappointment is that this version of movie has two scenes cut out- actually it pissed me off. Really? How can you!! Now, where to find and purchase the full uncut movie? 😭"

"So I'm in a couple different Horror movie fan groups on Facebook & I read alot of Horror movie articles online & for the last couple months I kept reading rave reviews of this movie. Some people even referring to it as ""Ethan Hawke's BEST movie.""  So I couldn't wait for it to be available to rent thru the streaming services. I was super excited to see it so I decided I'd but it for $24.99 instead of just renting it. Biggest mistake ever cuz this movie was a HUGE disappointment!!  I'm convinced the people who claimed this was 'Ethan Hawke's best film to date' - are obviously not very fond of Ethan Hawke cuz he was only actually in this movie for a total of probably 10 minutes thru out the entire movie & his scenes were very unclimatic. I'm mad at myself for spending $25 on it. If you're a Horror movie fan, like myself, wait for it to online for free cuz even $5.99 is too much to throw away on this one. Big, big Booooooo's!! 😠👎🏼"
It’s a great intense movie keeps you on your toes half the time ☁️ Excellent movie  🍿
Very thought provoking.💕👍

"Pitch perfect was a excellent first movie,not so perfect the 2nd time. I thought it was a good movie I just kept waiting for that great that was found and not forgotten from the 1st movie.The cup song and sene from the first movie I feel really got people talking,it was simple but unique and catchy I must say,but nevertheless still a movie to watch,actors were good but Rebel Wilson YOU are just GREAT,love you as a actor. This movie wouldn't be so great without her acting and Anna Kendrick singing 🎼"

"This is a Real Life Story of Dr Saray Stancic,amazing Life Changing documentary. Powerful, Life Changing now sharing this film with the World ...it’s changed and saved my life. I will always be grateful to Dr. Stancic💙"
"The movie is slow moving but filled with emotion. It is a movie about love letters. The letters written are the focal point of the movie. Love is rich in letters and develops so strong that not only do you live vicariously through her but also you feel the passion through the big screen. Gere, losing his wife and having a poor relationship with his son, the Doc needs to get away and solve some inherent concerns with his career. Diane Lane is a beautiful woman with a narcissistic husband. Her life is so dull and dreary that she contemplates taking her husband back after he drifted in an affair with another woman. Gere and Lane help each other in a paradise type world that - well you have to watch it - to know. The key in most relationships is if they just could have navigated life a little longer together then their love may have been even stronger---nothing should separate true love. Lane's daughter ends up really bonding with Lane, which is truly heartwarming. Great acting 🎭 - 4 stars because of the way it ends only. Rewrite a five star ending."

Great movie but have the tissues handy. Had the opportunity last week to stay in the house where it was filmed. So great to recognize places in the movie.  Love Richard Gere & Diane Lane. PS: Richard was there with us (see picture). 😍

"Because it was crude humor, and the use of the F word way too much,. I can't imagine normal people use that much profanity.  I had the feeling that the producer and director used it more for effect than necessary.  Didn't like Seth Rogen either😖"
Stupid funny but that's what I like 👍
Awesome movie!!! Keeps you on your toes😧

"I think the post office missed placed this package and before I could walk up there to sign for it, they sent it back. The seller was helpful and courtesy and refunded the entire amount back into my Amazon account for the mixup. It’s on Netflix now, so it may be a while until I buy it again. FYI: I realized that I was mistaken, it was River Phoenix who played Gary in this movie. Not Jaquan Phoenix. Very funny and heart warming. Loved Cool! His grandpa has some stories to tell him about cars he had and unforgettable times in the backs of them…at a later time of course!! lmao 🤣"

"One of the greatest epic classic from the best actor of all time. The only one direction's experience of Marlon Brando with another unforgettable character of the cinematography..., Karl Malden. Recommendable 1000%!👍"

"I got to see the new season  premiere  on pbs last week. Jane Lynch stars as Mr. Ratburn's oldest sister (she also voice Ms. Power  on WordGirl) who's also a wedding 💒 planner who Arthur and the gang think is the strict , Stern lady  Mr. Ratburn's marrying.  The kids try to match him up the librarian, hoping he can find someone nicer. Francona and Arthur head to a chocolate 🍫 shop and ask the owner for help to find a gift 🎁 to help their teacher win the heart of the librarian so he wouldn't  marry the strict lady.. They buy the chocolates  and write 📝 a letter pretending to be Mr. Ratburn but it doesn't work. They decide to speak at the wedding 💒 but at the wedding  they learn of Mr. Ratburn's older sister and that he's marrying the owner of the chocolate shop. The kids know what a kind, good man he is and he was perfect for their teacher. I loved the episode so much,  I wanted to buy it.  The rest of the episodes are just as great.  I laughed at the episode the longest 11minutes, an episode about the Internet being down and how the kids dealt with it. A great season so far."

"As an owner and lover of  German Shepherd dogs, I’ve been wanting to watch this movie for the longest time, unfortunately the movie wasn’t shown where we live. I also couldn’t find the dvd from our local stores, hence I was very happy when I found this on Amazon!<br />We thought it was a good idea to watch the movie with our Shepherd. Backtrack to when he was younger, he’d always react to barking sound coming from our phones or tablets, so we were a bit worried if he’d tear the TV apart when Rex appeared and barked on screen. As you can see in the pics, at times he was staring at the TV console. We reckoned he thought the barking was coming from behind the wall! 🤣 He did bark when he first heard Rex, but thank goodness he did not rip the TV apart!<br />The story is truly moving. It showcased the love and bond between handler and dog. Gave us a good glimpse of how it’s like in the battle field and how sniffer dogs work in war zones. War dog are just amazing. So glad they made this into a movie."

"Slow moving, uninteresting movie.  The acting was good and it was interesting to see them all age, but I kept thinking &#34;it has to get better&#34;.  It never did. 😞"
Sooo boring.....It was a chore to watch.😳😴
"Funny concept but, didn’t deliver it well. Most of the best parts were shown during the previews which sucks - I HATE when that happens. I really like Leslie Mann, she’s always so funny but she probably should’ve passed on this movie. And, John Cena should probably stick to wrestling, sorry dude. The movie was ok but, I wouldn’t watch it again which sucks because we purchased it thinking it would be good for sure - oh well. But, this is just my opinion, I can see others enjoying this movie but, I guess my expectations were too high. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Liberal agenda, stupid script, just a terrible movie. I hope to prevent anyone else from wasting money or time watching this crap. It deserves negative stars. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"

I initially liked that this was a two woman operation. For someone who loves old homes to watch the “pull it all down no matter how historic “ mode is heartbreaking. All the woodwork is stripped and thrown into a dumpster. Beautiful overhead lamps crumble as their demo crew quite literally hangs from the ceiling like monkeys. AND they think it’s FUNNY!🤦‍♀️

"Great show!  I did this review in party as a response to other reviews - I see a lot of complaints about the trial only having 3 or 4 episodes. If you start your trial while they are still running ""new"" episodes weekly (FYI: DISH, Directv etc all show a NEW season one episode at a time also) you will only get to watch what's aired.<br />tip : wait to start your trial till the whole season has ""shown"". Or if you can't view all in the trial period (or used your trial up already) pay a month or two, watch all, cancel.  I'm surprised how many seem to think they'll just automatically have every episode all at once.  No TV provider in my experience airs every episode of a new show in one week or month.  Older ones maybe yes.. new - there's waiting times.  😃"

The main reason  I Subscribed to up faith& family was, so that I could  watch the rest of the seasons. I'm going to be really disappointed if season 11 doesn't show up here soon. 😢😢"

"Where to begin. I really love 💕 this movie! I have been watching this movie ever since it first came out back in 1993. It’s really too bad they never made a sequel to it, they should have. I’m sure I’m not the only person that thought as to why they never made a sequel either! I love 💕 the story, the setting, music & great actors: Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan did a fantastic job! I had been watching this movie throughout the holiday season, but I also watch it all year too. If you have never seen it, please give it a watch. I love the music too. Please enjoy ☺️ watching “Sleepless In Seattle.” A wonderful, endless classic movie that’ll NEVER get old! Happy watching!"

"A CLASSIC Christmas movie! Very happy with this purchase... Some reviews mentioned the picture seems to be a little dark. I don't see this to be the case... the quality is no different than my trusty old VHS tape! I think it's simply because the movie was filmed in 1989! If watching this at least once every Christmas is not a tradition in your household, it should be...it's hysterical every time! 🎅❄️🎄"

I was a kid when the movie came out. This was horror to my generation. Probably the best time for any type of movie was the 80’s and 90’s. Buy it you won’t regret it. 🤟🏻

Fair casting ~ good acting 🎭 especially from cate Blanchett ~ good script weak ending! Worth watching but to see how many people rated it 5 stars ⭐️ (A perfect movie) is bizarre! But I guess your average person also hoarded toilet paper 🧻 LOL

SEASON 5 is a major disappointment... no story line to really follow and hardly any acting or real drama at all except all the parties and concerts and sexual garbage and now even the disgusting abomination of same sex propaganda of hollywood involved now ruining another what was a good tv show previously until season 5!!! GOD forbid! EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT!!!😒

"STRANGE MOVIE. Wow what a long strange trip. Nicolas Cage is good in it. It's kind of slow at the beginning, but does pick up. I think the best pay off was the crazy grin Nicolas Cage gives a the end. I laughed out loud 😂. We waited for a while for this come up free in prime, but never did. Soooo we paid $3.99 for. Was it worth it, that's up to you. It's definitely not an award winner, probably better them some of those wastes of time ( no country for old men or the hateful 8 that's 7 hours I'll never get back). Have fun with it."

"WHAT WAS THAT??!! Bizarre, cheap trip wouldn’t watch it under the influence. 10/10 weird. Truly truly strange, maybe in a good way but gratuitous violence...maybe in a good way? 🤔"

"I used to watch this movie with my best friend all the time when we were little. I thought of it recently for whatever reason and decided, hey, I haven't seen it since I was 10,  I loved it then, might as well buy it.<br />And I was not wrong! While its totally cheesy, it has a beautiful storyline and its always great to see Brit living up her innocent years 😁"

"My boys love there ninja costumes. They are well made and look better than the picture. My only issue is the throwing stars on the belt look like they hold the plastic ones but sadly they don't. I do however love that the plastic throwing stars are rounded by a circle, it shows how safety is most important. Thank you to whoever thought of that😄"

"Not what I expected in a good way! This was a great movie. It was not just another horror movie with a typical plot not a remake of another movie like someone had told me. It’s hard to give a review on this without spoilers, so... This movie has a lot of comedy in it reminds me of final destination style of film yet different.... spoiler alert 🚨 this is not just a remake of ground hog day. I was told that’s what the movie is and not to bother watching it but they were wrong. The movie is much more then that, lots of story and it’s great! So not a full plot spoiler at all but kind of."

I’ve seen the first and second one. This is actually one of my favorite movies. I like how the story goes. Girl dies on her birthday then the day reverses itself and she comes back. Which I think is pretty cool🥳💀.

"So, I watched the movie loved it, but when I look at the comments about how it's not kid-friendly, I'm like, did they look at the rating? When I start looking for movies for kids, or myself to watch, I always check the rating, which this movie is (PG) Parental Guidance. But, I'm in between 5-15 years old there's nothing wrong with this movie, your decision everyone if you want to let your kids watch it or watch it for yourself and tell them that it has nasty stuff, but overall great movie five stars would watch it again reminds of other movies but I don't care movies a movie soo. 🤷🤷"

"Disappointing.  Could have been so much better.  Had a few funny moments, but dialogue was a mix of cliches and other locker room moments.  Redford is characteristically wooden.  He has a history with his sidekick but its underdeveloped.  Nolte is a little more believable, but little depth to get past the more obnoxious aspects of his character.  Not that people aren't often boorish and boring, but there's a reason that this character type doesn't elicit compassion or even much curiosity.  So, two quite unlikely protagonists and, sadly, a somewhat shallow, mediocre river running throughout.😞"

My husband and I enjoyed the movie.  We are over 60 so that may have a little bearing on our outlook. Scenery is breathtaking and language was not that offensive to us as it was not every other word. A feel-good movie that makes an older individual want to get off the couch and go hiking (a short distance😄)

This movie was shot in the late 70’s… Right??<br /><br />Well that’s what I read and it appears they had some original footage but needed to fill a ton of gaps. Lots of recent footage mixed in where it clearly ought not be. 😂 There was a Tesla in one overhead shot of the concert parking. Hilarious.

"I'm already an Arsenal fan so I was always going to watch this and probably at least enjoy it. But I felt like I got to know this team even more through this series. It was a tough season to relive, given all the ups and downs, but seeing it from this perspective gave me new insight into how the players experienced it.<br /><br />It really painted a full picture of the club last season -- from the directors, the medical staff, and some Arsenal legends, to the players, Arteta, their families, and the fans. This series has reinforced my love for this team. One of the fans in the series said that a connection was lost over the last few years, but it's coming back. We're feeling inspired by them once more.<br /><br />And even though I'd seen all the games when they were live last season and already knew the outcomes, I still found myself cheering, groaning, and on the edge of my seat during the game clips in the episodes. Overall, very well done! I would watch so much more of this. Might even give the Tottenham AoN series a go (😬 I know that's scandalous as a Gunner, lol)."

"This is the most magnificent science-fiction movie I have seen in years. The acting is awesome, the musical score is hauntingly beautiful, and the sets are so realistic that you really feel you are out of this world. But don't take my word for it. Watch the movie! It has an epic romance and is destined to become as much a classic as the original The Day The Earth Stood Still(still my favorite after all these years!) I loved it!(Bought the poster, the shower curtain, the mousepad...I think I'm obsessed with the movie😎). I wish I had seen it in a theater, on the big screen. Wow! Imagine the special effects and action sequences that close!"

Finally watched the final chapter in the Skywalker Saga and I got say wasn’t that great. There was scenes that were good but not the movie as a whole just pile of nonsensical “what is happening? When did this happen? Why?” The abuse of C3PO. Yes he is annoying but dang the screenwriter didn’t like the character at all. The best character of the movie is Kyolo Ren/Adam Driver. You knew what he was doing throughout the entire film besides everyone else in the film 🤦🏽‍♀️ Also Palpatine is satan. This isn’t a Star Wars Movie but a mock of it. Watch Disney+ The Mandolarian for your fix. The people behind this series knows and appreciates Star Wars.  Critic Post Done. Have a great Cinco De Mayo!
Oh I love this movie this give my husband a lil jump 😃

Very good story development in season 6. Deeper exploration into the characters so we can gain more insight into their personalities. Love the Juliette plot. And Maddie has grown into an incredibly strong character. Deacon is still struggling with grief. Nashville is pure heart! Love this show.💙

"This movie is a complete failure. First off, it was designed for audiences 10 yrs younger than the previous movie. It was predictable and stupid. Second of all, the ruined most of the characters. They completely ruined Batman which is very dissapointing, and the made Wildstyle take on the role of a man while all the male characters ran around being stupid. The only good character was rex, but of course, he had to be the bad guy 😒. They also ruined the movie by making it a musical. The music itself wasn't even decent either. The only good part was the die hard reference."

Oh it's no big foot in this movie! Not even a shadow of him.. Basically this is just a waste of space on Amazon. 👎👎👎👎👎"

"It’s a Melbrook’s movie! Slick multi-entendre vulgarity with major sexual innuendo throughout… Sometimes dry, but many times very funny.<br /><br />Sadly, Madeline Kahn died at a very young age… She was a very gifted actress who was also in the comedy “What’s up Doc? With Barbra Streisand and Ryan O’Neal. An incredible comedy, too!<br /><br />History of the world part one takes us from there era of cavemen all the way to the 1800s... With plenty of irreverent comedy that will make you laugh at the nerve of Mel Brooks and all the actors who participated… It is very funny!<br /><br />We need to experience more movies where great actors make their cameo appearances to shine for a few moments while bringing on lots of laughter.<br /><br />Definitely worth the investment! 👍👍"

I agree...NOT happy I was on the 5th episode of season one and enjoying it because I have Amazon Prime. When I sign in the watch another season it's no longer included. So I called amazon to complain and they said they were not authorized to allow the show to be free anymore. They gave me $15 to continue watching more episodes...NOT a good enough solution for people that want to continue watching and have PRIME!!!! 😡

"What a great, fun movie.😂. Just what I needed.  I removed my ear buds to get rid of the irritating music and thoroughly enjoyed the fact that there isn't much dialogue given on the screen, so I have just watched a very enjoyable comedy in silence with the only sound being my laughter.<br /><br />In this time of turmoil on our planet, it is such a relief to shut it all down and be in peaceful relaxation while watching a silent movie.  Buster and the girlfriend were great!  How funny!"

This is a cool movie and still holds up. It had a slew of stars and up and comers and is probably the coolest western. I wouldn't say it's a classic but its a cool western. The coolest. So many oh snap moments in this movie. Like the one seen where Kurt Russell's character bumps into the kid and the kid says I'm not your kid I'll fight you right now and shows his pistol and Wyatt Earp just takes the gun and hits him on the head. 🤣 So many cool moves. Why Ike what ever do you mean. Let's have a spelling contest. 😂 And the line of all lines ... I'm your huckleberry ... 😎
Good movie!! Acting superb.😏
"So good 😍 classic guns, shootouts, friendship, right vs wrong."

"This movie is about love, as are all of Myazakis films. What I love about this the most is that Ponyo already knew what she wanted and her mother was able to entrust her into a family that loved her already almost as much as she loves her. A true testament to the story of the siren of the sea getting her legs, so to speak. Quite endearing and touching. 🐟 🐣🐥😍🍖🍖🍖HAM!"

"This movie is ultra bizarre.  About 3/4 of the film is delightful, happy, heartwarming and then WHAM.  I don’t even know how to classify The Piper except to suggest it’s a revenge film???  Certainly not your typical revenge film 😬<br /><br />The feel-good moments are heartfelt, heartwarming even joyous as a Christ-like savior enters a small village and saves it from a horrific plague of rats. The man and his 10 year old son literally transform the entire village into a happy home.  The man builds swings for the kiddos, makes improvements and really cares for these people.  However, the Chief turns the village against the man and his child with horrific results.  And horrific consequences.<br /><br />This is NOT a film children should watch.  It has gruesome violence and disturbing images.  I gave it 5 stars because The Piper is a great story, well acted and has a shock value you don’t often see — and I’ve watched some pretty disturbing movies.<br /><br />I don’t recommend this movie to sensitive people or people prone to nightmares.  Watch at your own risk."

Sad that Vince Vaughn did this movie!  Previews give you the idea it is as good as his others.  It is terrible.😖

Watching Chloe is a riveting series of indie-like, innovative  🎥 cinematography, exquisite set 🪟 design, stylish retro edits ✂️ and a sharp 📍 intriguing plot that thickens 🫕 paired with a classic, archetypal, femme 👩‍🎨 fatale, Erin Doherty who is fierce in her leading role as Becky Green, Helena and Sasha."

Watching valerian sexually harass his co-worker Laureline 🤢 throughout the movie.  I wanted to say no Valarian you are a jerk and she is not interested in you particularly as you seem to be senior in command.  That is 19.99 I will never get back.

"I am a huge 007 fan and have loved this series since the very first. However, this is the worst ever 😫, the plot sucks and way too mushy like a soap opera. I feel really bad for Daniel Craig this being his last one 😢, I don't know who wrote and directed this one but they should never do it again"

"I got pumped for this movie by seeing universal horror nights and saw multiple chuckys in person. Great horror story by having the setting inside an insane asylum so the viewer and the characters both don't know what's thing on or if anything are illusions. I also like how Andy from the original two movies was in this again. And also used all chucky mythology from all the movies and strangely works.  Has Jennifer Tilly, characters from past 🎥  and puts a spin on chuckys voodoo chant. Excellent movie with some laughs and good horror kills and suspense. I hope they keep going as Cult and Curse remind me of the original trilogy."

"It’s not woke culture if IT’S HISTORY! Fun seeing my hometown represented and most importantly lesbian history. Often we are made to think we never existed in history, so it’s awesome to see people tell their stories that are relatable at times. A lot of us grew up thinking how we felt was weird and unheard of.. that’s why we need queer representation!<br /><br />Abbi Jacobson and D'Arcy Carden tho 🔥🔥"

"I know I'm a bit late to the party reviewing this film, but I was DECADES late even knowing about Will ""Fresh Prince"" Smith's debut film!<br /><br />This story is about a, maybe, 16 - 18 year old who is used to just surviving on the streets, who makes the acquaintance of an ardent, smitten admirer. This young man, in exchange for Will's character's ""favors"", teaches him to speak and comport himself as one of the elitist class. Will's character succeeds so well at this that he is able to convince several wealthy couples that, not only is he a classmate of their respective Ivy League college children (whom he knows only by name), but that he is also the illegitimate son of Sidney Poitier, to the point that he is immediately and completely accepted at face value into the bosom of the family (without their childrens' knowledge, of course!).<br /><br />For all that this is a con-game, it seems more to be as a personal challenge than as a con for felony-worthy financial gain.<br /><br />The beginning of the end for the boy, and indeed the very end of the con itself, is brought about when the various couples (who all travel in the same obscenely wealthy social circles) compare notes about this admirable, lovely, personable young man - Sidney Poitier's illegitimate son - who has dropped into their lives and made such a positive impression on them and, realizing he is an imposter, report him to the police.<br /><br />And his actions cause a suicide.<br /><br /> I don't like to think about the ending because it's so sad, so I will be quiet about the rest of this story.<br /><br />As I said, this was Will Smith's debut film and because I have watched him grow up and grow in his career(s), I can say that, though you can tell he was a ""new talent"", his journey to fame would not take very long.  He was very fortunate that his debut film was populated by well recognized and even ""acting craft royalty"" actors like Sir Ian McKellen, Stockard Channing and Donald Southerland.<br /><br />The crazy thing is, in my own opinion, it was Will and Sir Ian who gave the most memorable performances in this film!<br /><br />About the ending- I watch Six Degrees of Separation every few months, but except for the first time I watched it, I always stop the movie right before he gets caught and arrested. Can't handle that tear-jerker ending 😭 !<br /><br />At any rate, as Siskel andEbert wouldsay, ""2 thumbs up""👍🏼👍🏼"

"I labeled this the point of no return.  This is a simple story of small town with ordinary familes with ordinary lives.  At first glance I thought the movie was in the early 80s until I saw them cell phones🤔😋.<br />Anyway, my take is this a coming of age story of a boy finding out his dad is a serial killer and what transpired to get him to commit the ultimate betrayal/crime.<br />Please watch.<br />#trust no one<br />#do what's right<br />#no spoilers from me😎"

The movie case came in slightly broken but it still closes and the movie itself was perfectly fine thanks so much 👍🏻

I watched this movie so much on cable during the pandemic I literally purchased the DVD to keep around b/c I knew eventually they would stop playing it! This movie takes risk that most newer movies lack to “stay safe” these days! In the words of the late great Maya Angelou “When someone shows you who they are... believe them!” 😮 This movie is a great reminder of why you should not just put your trust in everybody you come across & how do you REALLY know your person?

The middle part of the dvd case broke in transit and scratched the dvd. Then when I went to watch the dvd (seeing how much I could see) I found out this was a European video so my American blue ray player wouldn’t display the video anyways. All in all not a good purchase.  😥

"Let's be honest. You're only here if you know how good this movie is. No one's gonna blow $32 on a movie you can find on Netflix unless they know it's the gem (😉) it is. And Criterion has done an excellent job bringing this 4K transfer to the small screen.<br /><br />The goodies included are worth it in every way and this is way better than what Netflix throws at you. Get it if you're an enjoyer of raw, unfiltered, amazing cinema!"

"First let me say I loved the scenery and the village, fair job on that, and the fact that there is little foul language or family unfriendly matter most shows have today, love that too and appreciate it, wish we had a lot more shows like that. The acting was fair but there is only so much one can do with what is written and therein lies most of the problems with this ""adaptation.""  Having read the books many times I found the first series of the 70s -90s somewhat painful to watch in some respects as the original stories were often butchered, although I understand this always happens when translating books to film, I just don't really get that when its written about real life!  Just tell the story as it was!<br /><br />At any rate, the old TV version was much more true to form than this current version and Christopher Timothy, Robert Hardy, Peter Davidson, Mary Hignett and Carol Drinkwater were all stellar performers, and those who came in later did a pretty good job as well.  Hardy's interpretation of Siegfried was off the charts and Hignett as Mrs Hall was formidable, to say the least.  That being said, I watched the first few episodes of the new version with something akin to amusement and even a bit of cringing as I observed the obvious attempts made by these new actors to make these characters ""their own,"" to do their own interpretations, and quite frankly, I found it pretty disappointing.<br /><br />It is said that imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and in this case, it certainly would have also been a mercy as well, had the writers, as well as the actors, made a good hard study of the books and the previous shows and instead of seeing how far South they could all go and still call it All Creatures Great and Small, just done a remake of the first-rate kind!  If anything could have been done to make it their ""Own"" it would have been to do some of the stories more true to the originals as written, and for the writers to truthfully adapt some of the stories for film which were not yet told!<br /><br />I don't know, perhaps there is some kind of strange copyright infringement weirdness or something else that affected this whole deal or something I don't understand but if that is the case it would have been best to have just said ""forget it"" because for many fans of James Herriot out here who have read the books and even seen the original adaptations (which were a stretch from the books, though well-performed), this current attempt is a real travesty.  However, in a world practically starving for good clean family entertainment I give it 3 stars for that.<br /><br />I might add that I was sorry to see the writers felt compelled to so obviously portray Helen as such an aggressive character because according to all of the information in the books, although she was a strong woman, these writers are definitely ""putting words in her mouth"" which I realize all scripts and writers do but many of these scene additions had nothing to do with the original story!  These are agenda add-in's, things she probably would not have said, as a lady of that time period, and changing history with scripts Don't Make It So. I have seen this done a lot and its really shallow for writers to do this. Things were what they were.  How can we ever appreciate what we have now without seeing the past as it truly was?<br /><br />My only hope is that next season would be better, but I won't hold my breath. I am becoming accustomed to disappointment when it comes to these matters.  Final Note:  If Siegfried had a housekeeper that looked like Anna Madeley he probably would have married her 🙄!  C'mon man!!! Who did the casting?"

"Only the first episode has been released and I have already watched it 3 times. If you have ever watched the Yorkshire Vet you know about Dr Herriot, but this show takes you to the very beginning of how he became a famous vet. I’m super excited for the next episode and to see how the season unfolds. 🥰 pbs masterpiece theatre!"

"As a fan of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, I was curious. It’s a fun, must watch. Perfect blend of authenticity, Kitchin was and gore. Has a Reservoir Dogs meets John Wick feel to it with the humor and fight scenes…but it’s definitely a unique film in its own right.<br /><br />I can feel the depth of the characters, and I wish they could have been developed more — but couldn’t be done in 2 hours. Wondering if there’s a book, so I can delve into the back stories…?<br /><br />Anyway, just watch it already! 🤗🤗"

Wonder is wonderful. Should be shown in every classroom in America for its lessons on bullying. Particularly relevant to today’s age. Augie Pullman is an Everyman for any kid who ever felt different and didn’t fit in during adolescence. Great casting and superbly acted. Another feel good movie with a very human viewpoint. Loved it.👍

I loved this show!!  Wish I knew why CBS cancelled it.  I guess they were willing to invest in the usual formulaic crime and sit com crap.<br />There was a song “Angel” sung by Caitlin Canty that I have only been to find on iTunes.....still hoping another music streaming would add her rendition of that song.  😔

My Girl has been my favorite movie since I was a little girl and I have finally added it to my collection. Such a wonderful family movie and both in one case for $5 with fast shipping. Can't beat that! Was quite a nice surprise waiting on my front porch on this cloudy day 😍

"A bit corny at times but ok. The Spy Next Door is so much better.  The language killed it for me especially at the end, they really went over the top, so became awkward. Cardi b music unedited version 🤮 and of course an equal pay for women scene, so cringy and predictable.  Would not recommend for family movie night."

"Awesome movie, was my 2nd choice to Greenland which was terrible by the way. The cringe was really bad but everything else made up for it and as for people whining about the language or adult references......stop being a whiney little marshmallow I let my child watch it without any problems and you child has probably seen more violence and bad language in the video games they play along with my kid. I've seen worse language and adult references in movies like Shrek, Antz and various other animations. All in all we enjoyed it 👍"

"This film is probably the only amazing teen movie to ever be made! Lindsey Lohan is a great actress in this film. The story is very reminescent of Heathers minus the killing and language which is appropriate due to the film at times being dubbed the nickname ""PG Heathers"". The only nitpick I have is the ending dragging for a bit too much for my liking but besides that I highly reccomend this film! 😄"

I stumbled upon this movie on Amazon and not even half way thru had to purchase it. So many great actors together. Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer. 💗 Reading the story about the British singer Steve Tilston who the Lennon letter was to go to and seeing actual footage of him in the credits was great. I'm glad the movie did not mirror his real life but it helped make a good story line.

"I love, love , love this movie! Yes, I'm in my 60s. Yes, there is a portrait of me I keep locked in a room upstairs which has greatly deteriorated since the artist painted it. Yes, I made a secret wish. Yes, I look just as gorgeous now as I did when I was 22. But that's got nothin' to do with my fondness for this movie! Yes, I'm pulling all y'all's leg! 🤗"

I put the DVD in the player and  the disc was unrecognized by my Xbox. I tried troubleshooting it but nothing I did worked. I ended up returning the move and was super sad 😞

"I Am a Horse Lover since childhood. Loved goin to my Cousin's house in the Summertime. They had Horse's need I say More... Older now still get Excited when I am Around those Beautiful Equine's anywhere I go. I have 2 grandkids. My youngest has developed a 💘 Love for those Majestic Equine's. She has been taking horseback riding Lesson's this summer. My oldest Grandson is goin into high school in less than a month. He made 1st Chair in Band w his Trombone . His future in Band looks great. Awesome movie for him to watch and Learn. As for the Movie's The Horse Whisper Awesome. I would rate it a Thousand Star's. But I am Partial ! Just for the 💘 Love of Horse's. Cutting edge real stuff from the rehabilitation of the Horse and rider in All Area's. The MAGIC that happens between A Handsomely Rugged Cowboy and a Beautiful Lonely Woman Great storyline. That Scenery was absolutely Breath taking. You could NOT of ask for a better QUALITY of movie.  The other movie was 👍 great As well. Mr Holland's OPUS. Plus 4 stars Over the Top.He had Obstacles on All Sides... But He Persevered and WAS a 🏆 Winner. One of the Best Rewards a Teacher Can Receive is Thank You for Believing in Me. Pushing me when You Know there is Greatness inside that Student, and it is Attainable. But When those Students Come Back to HONOR that Teacher it Exzemptlify's ONE's INTEGRITY and CHARACTER of That Person. Give HONOR to whom HONOR is Due. I think I should have ordered 2 movies though. It Probably will be Worn Out Before Christmas. Look for another order real soon. Thanks Amazon You Are The Best !!!😍😍😍."

"""If it ain't broke don't fix it!"" They really need to put that phrase to heart before making creepy remakes like this...<br />  It was no near as entertaining as the original 70s version. Had more of a Gothic feel to it. ...🥶"

"It's rather hip to hate on this film and yes all the problems people list against it are 100% true, abundant use of stock footage, bad music and the focus Minira are all very present... and yet I still enjoyed it, and I enjoyed it a hella of alot more than the 1998 Jurassic Park ripoff garbage they put in theaters.<br /><br />This is a fun kids film, kinda in the same vein as a later Showa Gamera film, if I would compare this to anything I would compare it to &#34;Gamera vs. Viras&#34; due to the overuse of stock footage. The acting in the Japanese version is pretty surprisingly good, although the main kid and Minira is an exception at times and grates on my nerves a good deal!<br /><br /> The story has a good message of standing up for yourself and I think children can relate and would like that! The best part of the film is by far the fight with Gabara and it's fun to see Godzilla judo throw Gabara across Monster Island. The stuff from Godzilla's Son, Eibrah and DAM are frequent and comprises the majority of Godzilla's appearances in this film, unfortunate but no worst than some Gamera films.<br /><br /> I think probably the worst thing I can say about this film is the cringe-worthy, abominable children sung music that introduces this film and  appears at several points in the film. These kids screech in your ears and it's one of the worst sounds I've ever heard. The main instrumental theme is actually pretty catchy but the children sung music in this film is the absolute worst I've ever heard, and I like the Gamera theme but this AHHHH.<br /><br />All in all regardless, this film is a really fun kids movie and at least it's still a Godzilla movie, the worst yes, but a Godzilla movie nonetheless!<br /><br />P.S. Right until the end of the film, I was having a good time and was ready to rate this a 3....and then the friendly next door neighbor, mechanic said Minira was the God of Children (in the Japanese version) I lost it in hilarity, threw up in my mouth a little that this film may be insulating that MINIRA!!! is any sort of divine deity. I could not in good conscience keep the star after it said that😂😂😂"

This movie and the while series of  3 taken movies are among my all time favorites - while I don’t enjoy violence generally - Liam’s character Brian Millis shows the love of a dad for his dauughter that  makes him my hero - great action adventure movie with family love at its heart while showing the challenges of modern families today. 👍

"Honestly, I rather watch the movie and Havana Nights. So much better than this show and why didn’t anyone else step up to be ‘baby’ ?! I could not sit and watch this series because the actor didn’t look like she wanted to dance 💃 probably being forced ! Maybe if it were a different actor playing the baby I would endure it, but unfortunately not one I recommend. Let’s go back to the movies !"

"I love the movie Dirty Dancing. I have been watching the movie since the first second it came out on VHS. I've since upgraded to the DVD 🤗 I loved this version as a musical remake. The acting was great and the talent was too. Every remake is different. It will never be same as the original. Personally, I liked how issues and the changes of that generation were highlighted. How each character brought said issue to screen and made me love this remake. Kudos to you all."

Baby was too fat to do the lift. Lisa probably should have done baby's part...I am going to watch dirty dancing right now a couple of times to get this remake out of my head. Thank God for Patrick Swayzie. This was so 👎. Gotta go watch dirty dancing.

"MOVIE arrived at warp speed, was safely n carefully packed, n it is obviously brand new, just as promised. Not only was it still in shrink wrap, but even the shrink wrap showed no wear or dirt, so u get the sense it WASN'T stored in a hot, damp, or otherwise wrong place. And a GREAT deal, too! VERY CLASSY SELLER - Thank you! Im sure that when I DO watch the film, it'll be perfect. If not, I promise to return with an update (but don't hold ur breath 😉)"

Great series. Another hit from BritBox BUT....where the hell is the rest of season 2?<br />Season 2 has 6 episodes! 6! Not 4!!! Where are the 2 missing episodes of season 2? This is outrageous! The darn season abruptly ends in the middle of the storyline!!! Then I go looking and find out there are really 6 episodes so yes the season wasnt meant to be cut off!!! Amazon Prime either needs to fix this or no one should bother watching!!!! Who wants to watch a show they gets cut off in basically the middle? Major thumbs down 🤬🤬

"At first I did not really like the way the box cover was designed, mainly as far as the original image of Eastwood drawing his inspector badge, as opposed to the new one where he is holding his smoking barrel of his.44 Smith and Wesson Magnum., But after watching them all, and seeing how much easier it is to place them back into the case, I think I actually like the newer version of the box set better. 🔫"

This movie was weird and it sucked. I was so excited to watch it because I thought it was going to be a really good movie. The half of my family that watched it with me didn't like it either. I got my Hope's up for nothing apparently 🤣🤦‍♀️

"DVD didn’t just have scratches preventing CD reading/watching but it had gouges that would prevent any type of repair to view. I was aware this was used when purchased but I went on their description of “good condition”. I live out in the country so it’s quite the hassle to return for $10, which required me going to town, paying shipping to return and await reimbursement. Just disappointed, my kiddos were very excited to pick this movie out to view.  👎🏼"

I enjoyed this movie and Ryan Reynolds is always good to 👀 at… 😆
Way to much cussing for me 🤷🏽‍♂️
Hard to believe Deadpool can also do a squeaky clean rom-com about video games…but he pulled it off. 👍
Another green lanter movie for Ryan 😞
Purchase with confidence this is a good product 👌 good flick
"Ryan is funny and refreshing, except as Green Lantern🤭. Dead Pool, and I esp like The Hitman's Bodyguard. This film ranks up there as another hit. Great work Mr Reynolds 👏🏾"
Funny and good movie 🎥
Love this movie. I've watched it a dozen times and still see new things each time. 😊
"Great movie to watch with the family, it’s funny, silly action packed, and a love story all in one. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious 😆 his movies never disappoint."
Ryan Reynolds.  Funny and very Ryan Reynolds 😄
Love this movie! Funny and of course who doesn’t love Ryan R♥️😁
Ryan Reynolds movie all the way… interesting twists and good ending.. 👍🏼
Didn't care for the language 🤔
Funny movie not his best but definitely not green lantern 😂😂
I was glad I got to watch the movie but I was not happy that I didn’t buy it now I have to wait a little bit longer tell I can buy it 😢
This is the perfect movie for a night at home with family. It has some crazy parts but mostly PG.<br />Get ready to sit and enjoy a good almost 2 hours of laugh with popcorn and good company!!!<br />Keep your eyes open for extra celebrities around the movie 🍿 🎥
"Classic Ryan Reynolds playing the good guy badass with a heart of gold. Loved the originality of the plot and the love story. It wasn’t what I expected, and that’s a good thing! 😁"
"I'm happy to have it with the 2nd one<br />❤️🥳❤️<br />If you hear anyone saying it ain't SCARY, it's possibly because of knowing the urban legend tales first before the movie. So, I guess it made them see it coming. But, no matter what, it's a good horror movie with original taste that a killer chooses. The suspense catches ya enough to sit back and enjoy. If ya never seen the 2nd on, it's a worth one too. But, more at the edge of your seat 😳"

"I watch very few series on prime. They used to create great programming but haven't had much that interests me as it's all too politically motivated. Hanna was the one show I looked forward to. Needless to say this third season was a bummer. It had suspense so it was watchable but it had so many silly moments. No one would make decisions that these people made. They're highly trained CIA but they leave themselves open to later danger. Just a quick example is how they're being hunted and it's life and death supposedly if they're caught, and they are constantly seen on video camera. I mean really? Throw on a disguise at least! Just very amateur hour. Kinda like a stupid soap opera on mainstream tv. This show was much smarter than this the first two seasons. What kind of writing is this! I cared for these characters. That's my motivation for seeing the show through. Marissa and Hanna. I loved their relationship arc. But the show put itself into a corner with nowhere to go. The whole ultrax idea was riveting and I just think this show could have been more. They worked themselves out of a decent plot. I'm sad it's over. 😥"

I’m so glad Marissa and Hanna were able to form a bond and get on the same team. They were both fierce and hardcore to the very end. I’m sad that its over and there wont be another season. I got teary eyed watching the last episode😩

"I have watched all 3 seasons and just finished watching the 3rd one as soon as it came out. This is a great series where they combine both drama and action and spread through out all 3 seasons. Season one starts off amazing and really gives you a hook towards the end to make you wanna watch and watch again and again. Seasons one I will give it a 5 star because it starts off strong  with a lot of drama and action, now there are some scenes towards the end that are questionable but over all a great series. Season 2 I will give it a solid 4.5 star, starts off with immediate action as soon as it starts Now in this season it has two main characters not only Hanna but another young girl that like Hanna. This season goes more into detail of how Hanna and this other girl where made and drama and action between this two was amazing. It gives you a peak into the sick and diabolical plan of the association where Hanna was made.  It will keep you on your toes as it goes on I will warn you tho it does slow down a bit with a few episodes but every single episode has action and drama just don’t give up on it too fast like most of this 1 start reviews. Season 3 is a 4.8 stars although it starts off slow in the first few minutes in the first episode but then it just blew up and they kept it going episode after episode the drama and action and how very well they managed to put it together I am very sad tho that it was only 6 episodes instead of 8 like the last two seasons. Season 3 made me stay up till 4am just to watch it because it had me hooked on how it was gonna turn out. Over all this show is a solid 4.8 mostly because of some questionable scenes through out the season but I will recommend. Oh and Hanna (Esme) she played her character so well on every season and was amazed on how she was able to show how amazing of an actor she is I will definitely be following up with her futures work. I hope there’s a season 4 and on but I think this was the last one unfortunately 🥲🥲 only show I’ve actually liked 😭"

"This movie is so funny. All of the actors are perfect. Pedro Pascal's facial expressions just leave me laughing so hard I can't breathe. It's all campy and funny. If you even remotely love comedic ""horror"" movies, this is for you. If you want to look at it deeper, it can also be seen as an indictment of the ""work yourself to death for the company that doesn't care about you"" culture, but you can just enjoy it for the comedy that it is. Also, that Kelly Clarkson concert was off the chain!😆"

I thought that this was a ok 🎥movie but boring in a way. Not worth spending money on buying the DVD or Blueray  movie.  I bought the DVD thinking it would be a great story but wish now that I should have watched it first that way I would have not have bought the DVD of it. I love Tom Hanks  he was great in the movie like all his movies but it just was slow pace and boring.

We're not supposed to root for Becky. She's too likeable here - the author would NOT be pleased. Her cold-bloodedness is the foundation of her character. And terrible casting for Dobbin - Johnny Flynn is far too appealing and attractive 🙂

"Thank goodness 🙏 someone finally turned the lights on to this production, revealing the brilliant and vivid colors (admittedly I've not seen the entire 1st blu ray of this, only a comparison video). The prior media releases (especially vhs tape) was so bland that it may as well have been filmed in black and white. The picture quality back then compared to other Shaw Bros releases, lead me to believe that it was either filmed on bad stock or stored improperly in the vaults.<br />To me the picture quality upgrade is the bonus here. The main attractions are the interviews (particularly Gordon Liu's) as well as the long sought after Tribute to (Kung) Fu Sheng (though admittedly the picture quality is sub-par on the latter to say the least and German Dubbed as well, it's still better than nothing!) Not to mention that the original poster art is second to none that Shaw has ever put out. And the newly commissioned artwork ain't bad at all to boot!👍"

"Step aside Hobo with a Shotgun . This by far one of the most visceral films I’ve seen in years . Cinematography,musical score,etc. basic revenge plot but don’t let that stop you from seeing this film. I watch a lot of films and get somewhat bored with the same day in day out crap and pleasantly surprised when something totally unexpected comes my way. Forget if you don’t really like Cage in past films. Embrace this character and all that comes with it. Enjoy 😉."

Watch for cameo of James at the end of  He movie! 😺"

It’s tragic that the Hellboy trilogy was cancelled due to lack of box office sales. Word can’t describe how amazing this movie is, if you’re still reading this and haven’t bought it already so NOW!! 10/10 💯"

"HAVING READ TWO VOLUMINOUS BOOKS ON THE 1962 CUBAN MISSLE CRISIS I CAN UNEQUIVOCALLY STATE THIS FILM, ALBEIT BASED ON<br />SOME FACTUAL SITUATIONS, WAS EMPIRICALLY......FULL OF HOLES.........HOWEVER, LET ME SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

"Outstanding movie!  Absolutely love the two movies.  This whom he has the best  animation that I have ever seen in any film! Great job team HTTYD 2! They really should have won the Oscar for that alone. I'm not going to do a full review because many have done so before me,and done it much better than I could. There are  A couple of things I'm going to address though.  Contains spoilers<br /><br />First, I do agree with many that I wish that they would not have killed off Hiccup's Father Stoick. I really loved the idea of he and Valka having a second chance at their marriage. Second, I don't know why people are complaining about this film having a abnormal amount of death in it. Has anyone paid attention to Disney's movies? Like Big Hero 6? In that film, the parents are dead and the brother dies. All of Disney's films are like this. Even the new version of Cinderella. Both the parents die. Usually they just show the father dying in Cinderella,but that's Disney for you. By the way, I did like the  above mentioned films. I'm not bashing them. Just trying to make a point. I didn't like it that Stoick died, I wish he would not have. I just think it's a great film.  I also like the way they show how the kids and the dragons care for each other. It's amazing how they show that genuine emotion between the dragons and the kids. Unfortunately, Kids watch movies that are far worse than How To Train Your Dragon 2. Far more violent with death and many other things kids should not be watching. Anyway, loved the movie and looking forward to the third one😃"

"Actually liked it better then season 1.  People in bad reviews are way way to picky if they know so much about films let's see what they come up with😁and the bad review about EMT 'S REALLY? do you think anyone really picked those 2 min scenes apart I say your the only one. STANA is a great actress her emotional scenes are top notch, all the actors were great, and  I never liked Alice from the beginning  !!!!"

"Acting from those I said were OK, and even those I slammed in SSN1 have all stepped up there game.  The baddie accomplice revealed in SSN2's finale was easy to guess as we did here on our couch waaaaay back in the debut of SSN1 / Ep. 1 🙂.  Only major complaint is that the ""evil"" accompice should have gotten @ 10 more minutes of being dragged thru the mud, facing the cast in true meltdown form ...even just a good beating behind bars?  Maybe the producers didn't feel that the accomplice had enough acting chops?  Whatever,  but I did feel cheated that they didn't get more of what was coming to them.  The ending was rushed and unsatisfying.  Not a horrifically bad show, but as someone said in an earlier review.... a few friends around, a few drinls, all with some legalized cannibas would have made the haze of SSN1 more plausible and SSN2 overall more enjoyable.  PS: tacky calling that episode ""BOOM"" !"

Horrible and extremely sllllloooooowwww. Not as good as season 1. Really cannot understand how reviews allow them to get a season two! Hope 3 is better😑 .Trying to hang in there because of it not having all the extra and unnecessary sex scenes.....therefore you HAVE TO HAVE more interesting storyline with more thrillers.

"S2 was magnificent from the first scene of ep. 1 to the very last moment of ep.10. Performances by every actor were dynamite.  Stana's performance was so compelling, at times gut wrenching, so focused, so heart breaking and her PTSD scenes were award worthy. Bravo to this whole cast. It's a must see, really. Too bad didn't come on in time for Emmy considerations. Stana, long overdue for one or two+ . Now, Amazon please commit to a s3. I give this show 5🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

"First time I saw it, I hated it, but it grew on me. It has its issues - plenty of websites explain what's wrong with it - but put those gripes aside and enjoy it for what it is. What I like best are the subtle details you don't notice unless you watch several times. For example, early on, Jupiter grumbles that she hates her life. Then at the climax, her enemy says that she (the woman whom Jupiter is the reincarnation) hated her life. It's not there with spotlights and sirens or giant red flashing arrows, just there for a person who remembers... and I smile. And I adored the antics with Intergalactic Advocate Bob. 😁"

"After loving &#34;The Matrix,&#34; I am surprised that this movie is a creation of the Wachowski's.  F<br />Although the storyline itself was interesting, I found the dialogue to be somewhat corny, much of the acting wooden, and the music overstated as compared to the scenes it was<br />supporting.  The music overwhelmed the action as it was so loud that it was obnoxious.<br />I would love to support the Wachowski sisters but can't recommend this production.  The one star is for the depiction of reincarnation and that everything is connected.  Battles in space are probably as fast and furious as shown, but for viewing, the action was so quick that it was difficult to determine what was actually occurring onscreen, so they weren't enjoyable for me.😧"

I was happy about this series and cannot wait for more seasons I remember watching the old movies a ton as a kid and also remember hiding them from ny dad because they were Satanic 🤦🤣🤣 seeing this show back is so great and very nostalgic. They didn't butcher it at all and that makes me extra happy. Overall great and if you liked the movies (Minus Creepshow 3 haha go search that on YouTube oooofff lol )  you'll dig these 5/5

"It feels kind of lazy. I love creepshow and was looking forward to the new season. I noticed last season (I.e., season two) consisted of lazy writing and extremely cheesy actors/acting but had hoped they would get back to real horror, like the classic. After watching the first episode, I was extremely underwhelmed and even embarrassed for watching it. The second part of episode 1 was just plain bad… I hope the writers/actors get it together because I just can’t deal with how lazy, cheesy, and underwhelming this show has become 😞<br />EDIT…..<br />I tried, I really did; Especially considering us horror fans don’t get enough *good* content but I just can’t…. Waaaaay too cheesy and horrible stories/acting. Wow, so disappointed 😢 at least some people like it though 🤷‍♀️"

"The first two seasons of Creepshow had me entertained and I greatly enjoyed them, however the third season is  outright unbearable to watch. The episode titled ""Mums"" decided to get political, ""Queen Bee"" was just cringe inducing, ""Skeletons in the Closet"" was just kind of meh, and ""Familiar"" had me rolling my eyes so hard that I now have whiplash.<br />What happened to this show? 🙁<br /><br />If this doesn't improve by episode 3 then I'm going to be really concerned about Creepshow's future."

"This movie is not made for a relaxed movie night, .... the idea is great the carrying out is not  🤯 -  I thought Im ""slow "" to follow, then I found some you tube clips  - ""movie explained"". watch that first, you might enjoy the movie then. At least there are 2 good scenes, but they do not make up for the whole thing.  Wish I could go ""back"" and -not -watch the movie."

"I wish I could reply to people on here. Someone said this movie is bad because it erases dragonball Canon, claiming it gets rid of of the other 3 broly movies. (Which imo bio broly wasn't the best) but regardless, the dragon ball movies ARE NEVER CANON. They are not part of the main story AT ALL. They are just stories. Thats why there was resurrection of f and battle of the gods, but then when you watch the anime its goes through all that again. That guy has no idea what he was talkimg about and left a bad review out of stupidity xD its a great dragonball movie. If you see the comment talking about it ruining Canon, ignore it, that guy is clueless 😂"

"This so called movie made no sense. It starts at a point in the middle of nowhere. He's carrying a pack on his back with useless items. He had no provisions or supplies, except matches. Why he continues to carry his pack when he doesn't use most of the items in it, I don't know. This was not a movie, since there was no actual discernible story, that was worth watching. Good thing I watched it with Amazon prime, Otherwise, I'd want my money back! I'd even take back the one star rating that I gave it, It really deserves no stars! 😴😴😴😴"
That the obvious was not so obvious and without the narrative from the characters would have been hard to guess he was so book smart and dumb in his actions all at the same time as usual and similar to his other movies but this was entertaining 👍

This is just my type of movie. If you do not care for any natural disaster movies then you will not care for this movie. I will give it 10 stars if I could😊👏🏽

"Rotten Tomatoes has this as a 13? Well, I'm not a fan of many Tom's movies, but this one was excellent. The score ads ambience, the photography is very well done, the 2 lead characters have excellent chemistry (not Annabelle Willis, but Tom and Sophie Boutella 😍). The story line has substance and well-paced changes. Also, the movie's longer, which I really appreciate. The best movies are the ones you don't want to end. The movie also has a unique take. Throwing in some Dr. Jekle and maybe a different, yet unknown future character for Tom. Yeah, the movies really not bad, compared to today's sad state of movie offerings. Some say it doesn't know what it's trying to be. I say, quite over-analyzing, make some popcorn, and just enjoy the movie for what it is. Now, if only the female co-star was the former Mummy series' hottie, Rachel Weisz 😍! Well, then it would be 5 stars, easy."

"I was 22 when I saw Trainspotting in the Theatre & simply blown away. It mirrored the youth Heroine culture at that time anywhere in the world. It also had a fantastic soundtrack. 20 years later it was nice to check in on these guys to see where their lives ended up. I feel like I was catching up with old friends. I absolutely connected to these characters & how our generation interacted with  the world, both then & now. Sadly, The characters remind me of people In my neighborhood who made similar choices. 😕<br /><br />I was also Happy to see original cast members in this pic And I will be buying this soundtrack!"

It brought back memories of the world in the 60's and early 70's. Some places still are bad today. Very realistic and close to the times we live in today. What a wonderful cast and great music 🎶 for atmosphere. Never get tired of watching Sidney do his work.
"Just such a fun movie. Big Combo is much better than several of the post-WWII film noirs that get more attention. The dynamics of romances are vivid, and the menaces of the villains are so lurid. Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holliman are noteworthy in a stellar cast. Why? Watch the movie ❤️😉"

"Journey to the Center of the Earth: 1959 Blu-ray.<br />First off, it shipped almost immediately and arrived safely within 8 days...From the U.K.! That itself was Outstanding! 👍 so full 5 stars for this purchase!<br />This is an amazing movie. One of my favorite as a kid, I purchased the ""pan and scan"" VHS version in the 80's. When it became available on dvd I purchased that version and was immediately impressed of how visually stunning it was in widescreen. And now this masterpiece, on blu-ray; 1080p from 4K restoration, has found it's way into my collection.  Quite definitely the best I've ever seen this film. It's a breathtakingly colorful, crisp and sharp picture. Stereo PCM and optional 5.1DTS-HD Master audio options, so it sounds ""wicked"" on my soundsystem! The commentary is fun, entertaining and insightful. The isolated Bernard Hermann score is a melodic joy to listen to. It also has a cool collector's booklet with original reviews from 1959, a poster gallery and archive photos. If you're a fan, this is the Blu-ray Version for you! This is a Region B Blu-ray and a Multi Region Blu-ray player is required for viewing in the U.S."

"And then acts them out. This movie has funny stuff and Debbie Reynolds plays a mom you’ve met (“okay, honey” when her son is being completely kooky). Not a perfect movie but some priceless scenes. (Remember when your mom dated? Eeewww) Loved Lost in America (“you are not allowed to use the word ‘egg’”!), and He wrote and started in a great breakup movie (first place goes to “Celeste and Jesse Forever” which is a perfect movie actually)…can’t recall the title  😖 but it has many great scenes including with his brother (“I misjudged you”) plus Bruno Kirby (“the ludes kicked in, huh? You took them BOTH?!!!”) ."

"Started watching this show in the middle of season 5. I am now catching of on the past seasons. These prior seasons with Will, Diane, Alicia, and Eli are just astounding. The dynamic between them is amazing and it is like watching a different show. I now know what  the different boards meant about &#34;Team Will&#34;! Definitely broke my heart to see the actual scene where the voice mail was erased. I hate to see this show ending. Eli should win every acting award. although Eli will still be Nighcrawler to be as I love him in X2😊"

"Excellent if bittersweet movie about the amazing 😻 brothers Gibb.  You feel for Barry, being the eldest of the three, well 4 really if you count the youngest brother Andy, who is the only brother alive.  I highly recommend this movie. It’s fast paced and you get most of the pertinent information. I’ve seen other documentaries on The Bee Gees and I think I like this best. Wonderful melody 🎶 makers and their harmonies are priceless. I have to say I don’t know where I was during the “disco sucks” period. I love 💕 almost all music and would never have agreed with that statement. I still love their music."

Enjoyable and really far from reality. It helps when it comes to watch a disaster that will never happen. 😂😂😂

"The story line builds up perfectly and connects you to each and every one of the characters throughout the movie. If your looking for a movie to watch while you debate the effects of climate change, here you go. It is a very good representation of how our footprint on this Earth can be bigger than we expect, and have effects we never saw coming. The plot line is exciting and touching at the same time, and will leave you waiting for the part 2 (there isn't one😔😭)."

"An amazingly touching film that I can totally relate to, as I move into retirement age. The relationships with your kids as you age, sharing love with your spouse,supporting your spouse as he/she deals with health issues, trying to buck the system when government regulations make no sense and these regulations just cost you money. If you are 55+, strongly recommended. under age 55.... this film is a must. A compelling love story. Aaah! I will watch again! Now if could only get the old man to watch it with me!😉"

"No need for a detailed review here. But I'll say this, my sides still hurt! 🤣<br /><br />Humor is important, especially these days. So if you like an irreverent and good horror comedy, with a bunch of unlikely anti-hero types from East London fighting zombies, that's also thoughtful, well crafted and well acted, then look no further because you've found it in Cockneys Vs Zombies! Enjoy!"

"This is totally interesting if you like artsy movies. Actually,  I enjoyed the spin on this difficult subject matter seven in with poetry and music. It challenges women and men to use the power 💪 they have in order to realize the change one desires. Its a gritty but intriguing look at the violence in Chicago."

"Had to buy it and glad I did... have watched it 3 times (and i NEVER rewatch movies)  and the bonus content was great, well worth watching! I especially loved the part about the costumes. Overall the movie is totally engrossing from the opening to the end. The two ""Emma's"" (Stone and Thompson)  work so well together! The music, the costumes, the overall storyline- fantastic. I may watch it again today as a reward for cleaning the house lol 😆 😅!"

"Watching this movie was a complete and utter nightmare! My friends and I made jokes for most of the movie to cope with the boredom - could not finish the movie - it’s a great sleep aid. Even Ryan Gosling did not look enthused and probably thought of his paycheck on a daily basis. I was hoping that it would be better than the first movie, which I thought was very boring too, though it was a disaster . This is one of those movies you feel you should get repayment for screening it for the seller. 👎"

"i love this film, just rewatched it. solid coming of age story with an awesome soundtrack 🍊 they have songs in here from The Offspring, Jimmy Eat World, Cake, Sugarbomb, Brian Wilson, Lit, Crazy Town, and tons more! the cast is stacked as well. written by Mike White (School Of Rock, The White Lotus) and directed by Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher, Jumanji 1 & 2). Highly recommended if you like early 2000 comedy movies like Van Wilder, The New Guy, Saving Silverman, & the American Pie series."

It is really nostalgic to have the early 2000s DVD cover - which this doesn't have. I feel tricked. Why show the DVD with the early 2000s one if that's not what someone is really buying?<br /><br />That's not OK.  2 stars.☝️🤨

"What's not to like, with top notch special effects, great casting, action from start to finish, great script, timing and actors in touch with every character and their cohesion made the film work perfectly. This movie is highly entertaining. Aquaman and his Princess 👍 A dark version of this movie would be something I'd be interested in also, but this Aquaman is pretty amazing."

Not as good as everyone said it was. The thing that comes to mind is corny. Ocean master? King Arthur. The land and sea are one. 🙄 Just when you think it's a smooth flowing dialog they make it corny. They tried to hard for comic relief. Visually it is stunning. The CGI saves this movie. There are some odd music scores that don't quite go with the movie. The costumes have a scooby doo like feel to them. DC is trying to copy Marvel's playbook with the witty banter and comedy. Stop. This is DC. Look to Batman with Christian Bale for some clues. It's an ok movie to rent but I don't care to watch it again.

Pretty decent plotline for someone who never read comic books and enjoyable casting choices (William Defoe and Dolf Lundren!). The fight scenes in these movies have gotten so long and unnecessary to the plot of the movie! Could have easily been an hour and 45 min movie. Thank goodness for Amazon to kill time during all that overdone CGI🤗

"Music, dancing, acting, phenomenal characters and portrayals, story, love, sacrifice with redemptive meaning, beauty in ALL ...how petty that anyone could criticize this for any reason. The length was perfect, every part done so well the time flew by for me in watching it. I will be chilled in the effect it made upon me forever. 💓💜💛🎶💚💙💗"

"Firstly, the idea theres a giant squid 🦑 under the ice in europa is ridiculous.. here’s the thing about these types of movies, most of the people that watch them are academics or science enthusiasts… Therefore we will be just as thrilled with maybe microbes!! We don’t need some ridiculous Hollywood ending for it to be enjoyable! Also tons of inaccuracies the ice drill attached to a reconnaissance ship. Nonsense, sunlight Breaking through the ice when they supposedly drilled hundreds of metres nonsense! And why is there always such a fixation with radiation it’s always the first thing that creates a problem in these movies! I honestly thought at one point they were all going blind, that’s not a bad premise, alas, ice squids👀 🤦‍♂️"

I won't bother to explain the movie description as its in the details link box. But I will say it's a beautiful movie the music and story line are of a true classic film. The shipping a tad delayed for about a day which is no big deal to me anyways. The DVD cover wasn't what's shown in the description as its probably packaged by anthor company which honestly didn't bother me either. I've ordered other Indian Bollywood films that don't have the same exact covers. I assumed it was normal opposed to USA dvd covers which are all supposed to be the same . 😋😋😋<br />Any way great film must buy ; must add to collection 👍

"Came in a case. It wasn’t unopened and the dvd is clearly a burned dvd, not a Blu-ray dvd.<br />Though I do suppose I should have known better due to the price. Because it’s not a real dvd it makes everything difficult, like starting it over and other features available on a real Blu-ray. Basically a dvd you would buy at a flea market. Oh well 😏"

"I watched it all. There were a few moments I really laughed but the rest I was just thinking how strange and odd. Why should I keep watching it... lol. At the same time, I know it's hard to be funny and not laugh at your own jokes. They really just had to let their weird sides out. It was interesting and I'd watch another season if it was made. Hopefully they keep most of their clothes on. 🤣"
"I absolutely loved the show, was swept up in the ridiculous antics, practically rolling on the floor and then... I watched all episodes available and there was no 5th... I watch streaming so I can binge it, not wait a week for the next episode. If I'd known all episodes weren't available I wouldn't have started watching it. Lame move Amazon. 😶"
This show had me and my husband laughing hard. It was a slow start but once it gets rolling you're going to love it! I recommend you try playing along and see how long you last... 😉
"Good job Rebel!!! This was an Amazing experiment!!!! Any intelligent comedy mind is going to freak!! What a wild ride.. Thank you for bringing your side of the pond to ours🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Ash, United States"

Loved the movie.  Have been a fan since 70s.  Are there mistakes? Sure.  But this movie was about redemption and forgiveness.  Loved Ben Solos return.  Will watch this one again 👍🏻
"let me start from the film stand point first: I rented because, we were doing a star wars binge and I did not have the actual BD with me. I did not went to the actual theater release so I did not watch the film prior. After watching it with the family we reach almost a unanimous consensus; it was a ""so-so"" movie. It was a very predictable ending; they kill all the bad characters and all the good ones made the ultimate sacrifices. Matter of fact, it felt a little slow  and heavy.<br />Now the technical part: It was flawless. I watched on my 4K 📺  and we like the technical aspects of it. Although I think that the 4K release will have a little more ""oomph""."
"This movie while obviously having a good review is not for people who love the original three movies. I knew this was gonna be bad but couldn’t know how bad. We couldn’t stop mocking the corny story line and the Disney spin on the franchise. I’m glad it’s finally over.  JJ Abrams of course did an amazing job on the special affects and filming.  Disney please stop making Star Wars movies, please again and thank you 😋"
🤪🤯🥳🤤<br /><br />I don't know how else to put it.
Hello !  Did The People Who Made This Ever Watch The 1st The Movies ! 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️😎
The happy ending wasnt as happy as I'd like. 😞
"Every single thing that Disney has done with and to Star Wars has been absolutely atrocious and this was the final nail in the termite-infested coffin.<br /><br />I've seen others lament how they hated The Last Jedi or this movie, but Solo, Rogue One or The Force Awakens was actually good. Seriously? How can any human with good taste or those who've been gifted with hearing, sight or a modest intelligence, like anything Disney has churned out related to Star Wars? It boggles my mind. No, actually, it erodes my mind. Because it's hard to believe people who can tie their shoes or who can breathe, that they actually can also find any shred of merit in what Disney has done with this once brilliant series.<br /><br />The worst decision George Lucas ever made was to sell off this IP I believe. I will always love Lucas' creativity and skill, forever. The first real 6 Star Wars movies and The Clone Wars are amazing I think. But I'll forever resent Lucas on some basic level for letting this happen to Star Wars. It's not all his fault by far. He didn't defecate these Disney films and shows on us, Disney did. But, he made it possible and that's ultimately just as culpable I believe.<br /><br />Like I said, I thoroughly enjoyed the original 6, real, Star Wars movies. And I also really love the original, Lucas involved, Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated show. Though, I have no intention of watching the new episodes of that show because I've seen the brain-dead stuff that Dave Filoni is capable of when he doesn't have Lucas around to write for or with him. Because, Filoni, actually wrote a Jedi padawan having a combo light saber/blaster weapon in Star Wars: Rebels. This is a man who was also totally okay as a writer on The Mandalorian with having an infant Yoda. As I said, brain-dead, without Lucas on board.<br /><br />The Rise of Mediocrity was just the last straw for me, though. I enjoy masochism as much as the next person, I mean I actually watched all of these Disney Star Wars movies and shows, all the way through, so that should tell you enough about that. But, this movie, I mean... the Jedi powers in The Rise of Rey involve healing people (gee, why didn't Lucas' Jedis not think to use the Force to just ""heal"" everyone that was injured or mortally wounded?!) I'm sure Anakin would have been happy to save Padme from death, oh wait, that was a Sith thing supposedly with Darth Plaugeis the Wise, wasn't it? So, I guess Disney Jedi are actually the Sith.<br /><br />You also have the Force being used to bring the dead back to life in this feces of a film. Again, I bet Anakin wouldn't have minded Obi-Wan teaching him that ""Force Power."" Other moronic Disney Force powers include using the Jedi Amazon Force service to transport and teleport people and items across all space time. Is your buddy in a fight and forgot to pack his light saber? Well, just Force teleport it to him, Force Prime! Disney Force powers also include levitation and or flight... which is so effing stupid. Now, granted, by using the Force, Lucas' Jedis were able to leap incredible distances, fall from gigantic heights and slow themselves down greatly before impact and other amazing physical feats. But they were not frigging flying around like Peter Pan or Mary Reymond Sue here.<br /><br />Also, in this steaming dirty diaper of a film, you have space horses! Neighhhh, you say? No, it's true, horses in space. That's Disney's idea of a good Star Wars story. Oh, but wait, it gets even better! You also have some stupid chick in the film who has, and I kid you not, a bow and arrow! And she shoots down spaceships with arrows. I mean, can this movie get any more stupid?? Well, if you think the idea of zombies in Star Wars is magnificently STUPID? Then, yes it can. Because, being a zombie is the only explanation for how the spaceship shooting-down-with-Force-Lightning, Empower Palpatine, being alive somehow after being killed by Vader, being in this retarded movie, makes any sense at all.<br /><br />I could go on and on about everything monumentally stupid with The Rise of Skywalker and every single thing Disney has done to Star Wars, not the least of which would be all the SJW and feminist propaganda that's inserted as delicately as an elephant trying to sit in a Micro Machine car 🚗 , into every Disney Star Wars film. Or about how Disney and its mentally challenged writers go out of their way to destroy Star Wars canon and only bring the good original characters back so that they can kill them off in pointless, idiotic and terrible ways, unless they happen to be female. But, honestly, just thinking any more about just how much terrible, awful, uninspired, moronic, dusgusting, brain-dead stuff that Disney has done to this once magical, iconic and great film series. Well, it just has left exhausted. So, I'll leave saying, if you enjoy terrible cinema, Disney Star Wars will be the high point of your life no doubt, because it is just the worst of the worst in my opinion. Ed Wood would have made better Star Wars movies and shows."
"Great movie, few errors. First: bad<br />1. Rose Tico. NOT enough stage time. Awesome role model for any kid!!!<br />2. ""Ben Solo"" 🙄 No, ya can't turn into a hero by throwing away a really badly made lightsaber.<br />3. Reylo. 😡😡 No. Just no. Please y'all. C'mon. It's SO toxic. I mean, You torture each other!! You call each other a monster and nothing. Wow. romance.<br />Anyway, amazing movie!! Rey is awesome! Love the new characters! Rey is awesome! Love the Lesbian kiss! Rey is awesome!!<br /><br />-A ten year-old anti-reylo"
I loved it and then I was sad at the end ❤️😅😭
So bad it's funny<br />You can't think it's not hilariously bad. Maybe you think it's good if you're a fanboy that grew up on the terrible prequels...(those people do exist...🤦‍♂️ they no doubt vote democrat. Idiots)
Like these old movies instead of what they have now good for Sunday 🌧 afternoon

But there was nothing funny about this movie, nothing but gross scenes that only amuse the feeble-minded and the gross minded people!! I guess there are some people in the world that actually enjoyed this movie, case and point the men who posted reviews about this ""movie"". 👎👎😖"

"Based on a true story!

One of my fav French subtitled movies I saw it when I was 10 recommended by my big sister. I’ll always love the sene when the couple are swimming in the bathroom after plugging it up and sharing a kiss underwater while escaping the hungry meat eating neighbors. Also the ending is very cute as two music lovers play together what a  peaceful serene sense. A must see 😊

This movie is a classic! I loved it when it first came out and we recently rented it on Amazon and showed it to our kids. They were completely into it. This movie is intense and we love it! Plus... Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones! 🔥

If you can get past some of the acting at the start of the movie the rest of the movie is pretty good 😊

"I thought there was something wrong with me when I heard Lucy Arnaz praise this movie because I thought it was horrendous. Maybe because she comes from the industry she didn't want to be insulting? I don't know, but I certainly didn't see what she saw.<br />I really like Nicole Kidman as an actress, but she just did not make a good Lucille Ball and Javier Bardem wasn't Desi. None of it worked for me and I felt pretty bored throughout the movie.<br />Two thumbs down for me. 👎👎<br />The Hollywood Blacklist storyline could have been so much better. It's always a winning theme, but it failed here."

"Not the typical masala movie. This movie was underrated when it released as it may have been a little ahead of its time. But when you see this today, you might feel the relevance.Good acting by Farhan Akhtar. Deepika is hot as hell 😍😍😍😍"

"Perfect light hearted summertime 🎥 movie, 🎶 Music and whimsy.<br /><br />Who is living her best Diva life ?<br /><br />I kept thinking during the movie that a daughter is channeling her mother’s career while creating the art she loves and is skilled at!!<br /><br />Long time fan.. Just the movie we needed this summer to have that feel good moment."
"Fun and entertaining movie. Very light-hearted and was a perfect escape. Tracee was fantastic, Dakota was charming and Ice Cube was funny. All around good movie.  Can't wait to watch it again, tomorrow 😁"
"This movie is disgusting. Police brutality, abuse of power, date rape, misogyny. These things are shown all in either a heroic or comedic way in this movie, which is objectively problematic.<br />I'm not surprised I've never heard of this before. If I was Seth Rogen, I wouldn't talk about it either.<br />Grooooosssss 🤢"

"IF, you enjoy a lot of running and jumping and hopping from building to building and just running all over the town for the better part of these movies.. then these movies are for you.. but I prefer a movie that has more fighting sequences that are good instead of watching a marathon ..i got tired just watching the first movie ..and the 2nd movie more of the same.. so I would not recommend these movies because most of the action is in all of the running and jumping up and down on buildings.and dodging bullets...all over town..👎👎👎👎👎"

I watched it once, then a few days later I was thinking about something that happened towards the beginning that I wanted to see again. I only intended to watch that part, but got pulled in and watched the whole thing again! 😂 Beautiful movie."

"I LOVE Venus Wars! However, this Blu-ray version really upset me. They freaking dubbed OVER the original English language! WHY??! The original was perfect! It may have been okay if you dubbed over it using the same dialogue, but no, they changed it!<br /><br />Pros: Great visual improvement and detail. They cleaned it up very well. Kept the same Good Music! Cheesy is good 👍lol<br /><br />CONS: STUPID TO CHANGE THE DIALOGUE when the Original voice and dialogue was perfect! The characters don't feel the same, which is sad. I would run the Blu-ray for visual and play the old in the background lol<br /><br />Either way, I bought it to promote the love for Venus Wars, one of the most underrated classic Anime. If you love watching in Subtitles, then my cons for this is void. ^^"

The movie buffered the whole time. And then it would skip every so often. We checked our wifi had all the right download speeds. Sadly it’s not the first time we’ve had issues with prime videos 😔

"SPOILERS HERE😀<br />Beautiful film , wonderful concept - reminiscent of “Judy “ in that we focus on a small piece of the history , 1952-4.<br />How sad these true kings of comedy struggled to make a buck in their later years - as they watched reruns of their films in tv , making money for the station only . And butchered for commercials .<br />They took up an offer to tour Europe . Many American stars had to make that voyage to keep the home fires burning : Josephine Baker , Paul (“old man river “), everly<br />brothers , Gene Vincent , jerry lewis , little richard, Carl perkins , Charlie Chaplin , et al.<br /><br />For the l and h purist , theres a lot here to be exasperated over . The story here is they went to Europe in 1952 to promote a new movie “Robin Hood”. Well, if that’s for real ....it was 1947. The project never jelled . And I doubt laurel was busy writing scenes for it at the time.<br />If they did travel to promote a film , it certainly was for “Robinson crusoeland  / “atoll k”, a wild , long picture they completed in 1951! Filmed in Paris .<br />Even if they used the 1947 European tour in the story , correct me if I’m wrong , but we see Stan interviewing w 20th century Fox (?) , which  Stan and Ollie left in total disgust in 1945 ! Although w Fox they made financially successful pictures , artistically it was mostly a bust . There were , say TWO good efforts over 4 years - they were asked to renew the contracts . They said no. They were all B pictures , which dictated they modify their characterizations to fit into the new , faster , wise cracking style of Abbott and Costello .<br />The picture depressingly gets it wrong , saying they never made another USA personal appearance after they returned home in 1954! They did two tv appearances and in the basis of “this is your life “, late in 1954, they were signed to do their own specials !!! Wow !<br />That’s what happens in these biopics . The jerry Lee, james Brown , elvis presley , little richard projects had horrifying errors in the timeline and portrayals .<br />But here we get the nonsensical inner drama that Stan would deceive Ollie - enough to keep the ailing actor going through a grueling tour .<br />I doubt Stan complained when ollie went solo after stans Hal Roach contract expired. Ollie made “Zenobia”, a nice mild , non surreal comedy in 1939.<br />(He actually encouraged hardy to make pictures w John Wayne and Bing Crosby in 1949-50, when he was not In shape to perform !).<br /><br />The character of Bernard delfont is portrayed as a newcomer who didn’t give a damm about a grueling tour , often forcing “the boys” to stay in old beat up lodgings . Actually he was with them from at least 1940 and although he screwed up the negotiations from switching from Hal Roach to the “bigs”, he was very close to them , a very trusted friend .<br /><br />Another sticking point : hardy , as brilliant a mime and comedy genius as he was, was not interested in suggesting dialogue and gags . It was ALL Stan , on the creative side , or at least in the writing and blocking .<br /><br />Positives: the producers used actual locations to film scenes ! They also took the time to access newsreel footage of the tour , for recreation .<br /><br />A big positive is that in the tradition of the classic comedies , it doesn’t run over two hours !<br /><br />And yes, the actors do a terrific job , obviously a labor of love .<br /><br />And enjoy the sensational cinematography ."

"Couple of main characters speak a foreign language and subtitles insists it is - Albanian, including a song that plays in one of the first few episodes of season one, in fact, they speak Kurdish (Lale and the guys with her). I expect more from Amazon prime. Albania is in Balkans, right above Italy on the map and not sure why you mistaken Kurdish with Albanian. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"

I like it watch movies that are in some way connected together. I play this one with Thank God It's Friday with a still relatively unknown Donna Summer. Late 70's and early 80's . Both considered campy fun movies and my husband who is from West Africa is learning what fun watching and singing along can be 😎
Arrived fast and high quality DVD. 😁✔👍
Just watched Xanadu...ty so much going to watch again with friends tonight....sing along wit kids! Great seller AA😎
This was such a good film I feel bad just now watching it after she passed away last year and recently watch it this yeat I mostly watched her in Grease but Xanadu I hate it was a flop yes the plot doesn't make sense but the music and her of course olivia is amazing I love the music and everyone in it the title song is amazing she will be missed she was so talented taken to soon :( RIP LEGEND 🙏 💔

UGH don’t waste your time. If you want to see this movie go into the woods at night with a friend. NO flashlight no nothing!!! Then run around and try to record videos of each other again no lighting at all!!! Make sure there is rain and mud. Then when you get hungry go look for a cow to milk so your friend can cook some biscuits...there you go that’s the movie BUT it was so freaking long and the opening made no sense....I get it I do it was a big fat red arrow saying watch and you will see what this nonsense means at the end!!! Oh the end also made no freaking sense 😱 don’t waste time or money.....

Lo compré para nuestro PS4 y funcionó de maravilla 🤩
It won't play on my blu ray player 😒
I was happy when i bought this collection because of the price is really good deal but i got dissapointed because the spanish dubbed is from spain not the spanish from latino 😭 i don't how to return it i don't want it
I can't watch it in any of my DVD players I bought a Bluray player and it keeps saying you can't read it😢😩
"Weirdly, I have to say I agree with most critic's reviews of this film. It lacks in plot heavily, however, if you have a love for abimation this film is truly spectacular. The animation is gorgeous, rhe soundtrack is perfect. The direction is wonderful. I find myself watchibg this movie over and over solely for the aesthetic. It is so very appealing. The cooking scenes inspired  me to get up and make food. The feeling of family love comes across so well... highly reccommend to any anime fans🤓"

"The many times I would skim right over the thumbnail because I thought I already knew the story and the same ole plot line.  I was wrong.  Seriously wrong.<br /><br />This movie is like modern-day Greek mythology:  things happen, it flies on the wings fear, betrayal of self or by a close-one follows, you done me wrong, sworn off banished from the kingdom, confront then slay the seven-headed hydra.<br />Later:  the prince becomes a king and secures his queen; you my dear-friend/protector I give you back your chariot, and you will always be my ride-or-die; I fire off our torch into the constellations; peace is restored to the kingdom; and all live happily ever after😊<br /><br />The genre says ‘Drama’ and that’s what this movie is.  A good drama none restricted by some label or category.  This movie doesn’t come across as LGBT only because the story is universal.  Anyone can get with the characters because you may already know/have them in your personal life already.<br />Nothing about this film is contrived, cries sympathy, rights, agenda pushing, orientation, and/nor gratuitous symbolism.<br /><br />Glad I’d finally stopped pre-judging the thumbnail with a stinky-face and gave this movie a go.<br /><br />Nice work, Keith Behrman"

"Funny as H*LL. The Title starts the madness and it never stops! DBAMTSCWYDYJITH, what about Astray telling Odog that Dishiks pregnant.😂 (Sooo wrong). In my opinion Shaun and Marlyn are great Comedy actors who can make you laugh tears! BTW I think you should watch some of the movies mocked in this flick. These movies are SUPER serious. While DBAMTSCWYDYJITH is Super ridiculously Funny. Shaun and Marlin are funny actors. LiL. Man is funny too."

I am very happy with the service provided and words just can’t express the brilliant acting job of Rami Malek .... all things considered ..... the make-up false teeth to fit Freddy’s over bite ! But mostly the posturing and matching his movements to a tee 😀

They do such a good job making fun of the Minnesota accent and "" American small town family values"".  Absolutely hilarious, makes me laugh my ass off every single time I watch it!! 😂"

"The 1977 version with Richard Chamberlain is a cinematic MASTERPIECE!! ..and one of my favorite films of all time!<br /><br />The DiCaprio version,  (although well cast) falls incredibly short in all facets! The real story is lost in this version.<br /><br />***DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!***<br /><br />***P.S. The 1977 version is currently on PRIME!👍"

"It's a superb movies of this era which is rare these days. The title is misleading however. One might think it's a movie that was produced and filmed in the 1980s, but that is not so. It was made and featured in the year 2018 or around that time and only the timeline in the plot was 1984. They didn't do too good a job portraying that. They threw in some 80s styles and hair dos and a vote Reagan yard sign and 80s police style car and landlines, but other than that it looked like this era of style. Ok, maybe they did try to convey it more than I thought, but basically a viewer could tell within five minutes of watching when the movie was actually made. But, it was good. The chemistry between the boys seemed genuine and that too is rare these days. No fat shaming at all or teasing for the heavy set boy from his friends because friends don't do that. Not in this movie and thumbs up to that! Lots of sex talk but most teenage boys do have that on their minds, so that's not really acceptable, but understandable. It's a suspenseful movie about four tight friends who try to prove that their next door cop  neighbor is behind mass killings during the summer of 1984. The man who played the cop fit the bill to a tee and thumbs up to his good acting! I wasn't too thrilled with the ending. It was a little disappointing, but again what a person expects to happen doesn't happen, so maybe this movie really is a five 🌟"

The chemistry between the boys seemed genuine and that too is rare these days. No fat shaming at all or teasing for the heavy set boy from his friends because friends don't do that. Not in this movie and thumbs up to that! Lots of sex talk but most teenage boys do have that on their minds, so that's not really acceptable, but understandable. It's a suspenseful movie about four tight friends who try to prove that their next door cop  neighbor is behind mass killings during the summer of 1984. The man who played the cop fit the bill to a tee and thumbs up to his good acting! I wasn't too thrilled with the ending. It was a little disappointing, but again what a person expects to happen doesn't happen, so maybe this movie really is a five 🌟"
This is a good sleeper movie because it didn't get much advertisement. A true story with great actors. I'll wait anything Ron Howard directed.<br />👍👍👍👍

"This is my all time favorite movie, seeing it as a kid I really didn’t get the message but long story short it’s a social commentary about white Privilege. I think it aged well, it doesn’t focus on hurting or insulting white people it does it in a light hearted, and also picks at other people way using humor to create an opening for a deeper conversation. Other movies were created racist at heart with no intention behind it and people like to come back to this movie and point fingers completely missing the issue. 🤨 there age great YouTube videos about this movie that can explain it,"

I enjoyed this film because it was a very touching story about really getting to know a person and who they really are on the inside and I believ that of s what counts the most. also it had an uplifting ending.😺

"Bliss would've been amazing had it been a 3 or 4-part series versus a movie, because it really needed more space for the unpacking of the storyline.  It felt rushed, which can sometimes happen with films like this one.<br /><br />I love such concepts, yet fully realize that NPCs will not and walk away confused by them. Hence, the 1 and 2-star reviews. 🤭<br /><br />Anyhoo, I encourage you to not watch this film, but rather push play to EXPERIENCE it with an open mind."

Poorly written. Mediocre acting at best. CGI lion was comical. Really wanted to like this movie because I'm a fan of Idris Elba but 20 minutes in I could tell that it was going to be a huge disappointment. 👎

"Doc about the origins of the Black Metal scene, what made it worldwide. Murder, Mayhem, absolute chaos and it's demise because of media demonization and RATS, this was music for a generation that gave zero Fks and did not sell out as you see in the West. Because of posers, it was made the laughing stock of a generation but it still has a strong following REGUARDLESS 😉"

For a PG 13 horror movie this was a good one. My daughter and I watched it lastnight and for a 14 year girl she didn't pick up her phone once. 😂 She was locked into the movie. It was creepy for a PG 13 movie. Being a big time horror fan the ending left me questioning... Wait... what? You have to watch it to see what I mean. 😉

"PROS:  I was impressed with cinematography, if you note many scenes are choreographed and framed beautifully.  This actually keeps you watching the slow story line.  That, along w great performances by Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor.  All the cast commits and acts out the obvious plot.  But Jack Reynor stood out.  He conveyed a major character change w the camera never leaving his face...  and he's almost to the point where he can emote thru film media.  (not at ""Das Boot"" where you can smell the sweat, but he's developing).<br />Expect 2c more of these two actors.  Tertiary actors were fine; The Good Place William Jackson Harper (Chidi)  stood out.<br />CONS:  Storyline was plain stupid (think M Night Shyamalan's The Village), and unnecessary disqusting.  BE WARNED: flay and skin a man aka Vikings, male front nudity, graphic sex scence, vagina secretions and hair 😱, suicide, and smashing heads open w a club! Good director - please find better material!"

This movie was awful. Sorry to those of you that liked it. I didn't. I like the main characters in the story I'm a big fan of Bryan Greenburg and Alexis Bledel but this was just blah. Glad it was free bc if I had to have paid for it I would have been mad. The acting was just awful as well. 😳

"Very witty screenplay . Very strong , nuanced portrayal of a talented and determined woman , Maya , now 40, playing catch up w society …with herself . Sad she can only get hired by …..exaggerating …on her resume . (Stretches credulity that in 2017, a corporation would hire anyone claiming to be a Harvard graduate , without making a call or two , and verifying who they spoke to. But….okay. It’s a movie😀).<br />She then treads water in a corporate environment , in New York . Or was it L A?<br /><br />Better than average “go - girl” exposition , despite a lot of scenes which seem forced .<br /><br />It comes off like a really good hallmark movie (despite the cussing and cynicism )"

"Eh. This movie had a couple funny parts, but mostly, a lot of cursing; that was a BIG mistake. Some cuts in movie didn't match the scene...🧐 I don't know? I just don't go to the movies anymore unless it is a Christian flix, since Hollywood has gone totally crazy and dark.! I thought: Lopez movies are usually okay and fun, but this fell short, big time."

"Before I get into my review I just wanna say this: I really respect Kate Winslet she's easily the most genuine woman in Hollywood at least if her interviews and things like that are to be believed. Keep in mind I have ZERO interest in celebs/Hollywood don't care and never will so trust me me saying this is a big deal. Unlike 99.9% of other famous women who lie about getting plastic surgery, make themselves out to be perfect goddesses which in turn makes us mere mortals aka regular women and young girls feel horrible about ourselves and gives us unrealistic goals Kate is real she talks about her flaws, talks about how she's insecure and talks about how Hollywood isn't perfect and how a lot of high up in the business people shamed her and still do. So I have mad respect for her.<br /><br />Now on to my review: This show was really well made, the acting was great, they did a great job at expanding the original movie's story (I haven't seen the original Joan Crawford version in a while but I grew up on it and on countless other older movies my mom even though she was born in the 60's has always loved older movies anything after 1960 is a no go lol), the music was fantastic, the settings were beautiful everything was perfect. If you liked the orginal then you'll like this too, promise.<br /><br />The only thing I wasn't crazy about was some of the characters and that's no fault of the show or even the actors. They did an amazing job and worked with what they were given following the story. I just couldn't stand these characters: Veda (not surprising i'm sure, doubt there's many people out there that actually do like her lol) and Monty. Now Mildred isn't on the same plain of dislike as Veda and Monty are not by a long shot but really didn't like her all that much as a character either, not counting that she didn't have any personality and was boring I hated how much of a weakling she was, lost count at how many times I wanted to just jump through the screen and do what she should've done and despite how HORRIBLY Veda treated her she still bent over backwards over and over again in an attempt to get that psychopath to love her. Veda is just hands down a psychopath there's literally NO redeeming qualities about her, absolutely nothing she's just a nasty person through and through, and Monty is just a bum, before Mildred found out who he really was he put on an act pretending to be wealthy then when they got together he just used her as his own personal bank and took advantage of her not working not doing anything heck not even being there for her emotionally either (many times in the show in the beginning of their relationship Mildred actually catches him and Veda making fun of her) he does nothing expect exist and throw her some booty from time to time... towards the end of the show when she's really stressed out and busy she gets snappy with him (as most people who are under a lot of stress tend to do) he decides to screw Veda (Am I the only one grossed out by that? 🤢 That Veda kissed and slept with a man who was with her mother sexually? She was kissing a man who just a couple scenes before hand had that same mouth on her own mommas no no area... gross ha) all that happens then he tries to blame her for everything...<br /><br />I could go on and on ha but since this is already long enough as it is i'm gonna wrap things up. Bottom line is I really liked this movie and highly reccomend it BUT be warned this show has some of the worst characters."

"Loved this dark/quirky comedy! I was lol-ing throughout! The situations are zany and the lead is so adorkable. I couldn’t believe what a small budget this film was done for, considering how awesome the directing/writing/acting was. I give five biiig bright stars for this movie!! 💫"
"I once owned KORONOS (1957) on DVD which was not in good film quality from Image Home Entertainment back in the year of 2000 and its one of the few 1950s Sci-Fi movies that need to be release on BLU-RAY for the first time in this 21st century! Come on my dear people let’s make Shout!

"I once owned KORONOS (1957) on DVD which was not in good film quality from Image Home Entertainment back in the year of 2000 and its one of the few 1950s Sci-Fi movies that need to be release on BLU-RAY for the first time in this 21st century! Come on my dear people let’s make Shout! Factory, KL Studio Classics, Criterion Collection and Arrow Video to accept our request for the lost and forgotten 1950’s Sci-Fi Horror Classics that need to have their BLU-RAY debut soon as possible! Thank you!😊👍"

It film follows The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative journalist unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the Spotlight team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The film features an ensemble cast including Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, and Stanley Tucci, with Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup in supporting roles.<br /><br />Covering the span of approximately 30 years worth of interactions ‘Spotlight’ is in the perfect position to be considerably incomprehensible; with the exception of some dialogue centered around name drops (𝒘𝒉𝒊𝒄𝒉 𝒊𝒔 𝒎𝒚 𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉 𝒏𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒔 🙄) and those in which characters are expected to read between the lines Singer and McCarthys’ writing and direction makes for an investigation that is gripping and easily digested. Still a tough pill to swallow regardless: there is a deeply intimate intermingling of elements throughout that threatens convolution, but the networks of communication and their subsequent influence on the main conflict are maintained as priorities. At times there are characteristics that seem persistently internalized (like motivation), the lack of cognizance in these regards doesn’t  distract from the bigger picture at hand.<br /><br />In preparation for their specific roles both Keaton and Ruffalo met with their real life counterparts (Walter Robinson and Michael Rezendes, respectively). The interviews conducted between them happened over the course of several months (with both Robinson and Resendez often on set) and involved lengthy attempts at replicating and adapting their various patterns of behavior (including vocal patterns!). Their subsequent representations on-screen were reacted to approvingly and they went as far as separately agreeing that watching Ruffalo and Keaton was “like looking into a mirror”. What's most impressive is the humbling dramatization of their performances and the fact that they remain statically dignifying: they never rise above the seriousness of the enclosed subject matter while still packing a punch. As equally important is the presence of those representing victims interviewed -  with Jimmy LeBlanc being an actual survival of clergy abuse-  and the extent at which they deliver dialogue that is both tear worthy and contextually insightful.<br /><br />Due to the fidelity to its subject matter and commitment to authenticity this is the first movie to win the prestige of a Veritas Award. This devotion goes above and beyond flashy aesthetics and gritty screenplay through the use of reporters (including those from 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑮𝒍𝒐𝒃𝒆 itself) being regularly referred to for their input regarding artistic and alternatively pragmatic related decisions. As a result of this sensitive pieces of information are leafed through, but they're parsimonious summaries are executed without sacrificing the overarching integrity of ‘Spotlight’ as a whole. It is worth noting that some characters have been noted as being misrepresented (like Paquin’s openness to admitting to abusing anybody being exaggerated and happening much earlier than it did in real life), but these alterations elaborate on the systematic nature of this investigation and the enormity of roadblocks compromising its success.<br /><br />Me? I have no way of personally connecting to scandals regarding sexual abuse happening within the context of a religious  institution, but ‘Spotlight’ makes no presumptions about its audience to the point of apathy or indifference.  This certainly isn't the most exciting watch, but it's expertly crafted, expertly researched, and expertly contained.<br />Above all else: any film tackling a culture of silence in this regard has my utmost gratitude, and the Vatican recently announcing the appointment of a tribunal in an attempt to hold accused Bishops accountable speaks to the transformative nature of films like this that are often hiding in plain sight.<br />For those of you out there struggling with this form of exploitation I always like to explicitly say that I am here for you.<br />That I don't need to live your truth to enthusiastically engage with it.<br />That your truth is always worth listening to: I guarantee that<br /><br /> For anyone interested in knowing more about clergy abuse and to anyone that needs to file a report please refer to the following resources as necessary:<br />https://www.camdendiocese.org/clergysexabuseresources/<br />https://reportbishopabuse.org/"

This is one of my personal favorites from MST3000. Joe Estavez really stays small compared to the giant headed Soultaking boss he disappoints. Also a Jim McMann lookalike puts a great mullet to work to bail out his fleeing friend. Not currently on the Rifftrax site so I grabbed it here and dust it off to get my MST/ Estavez Fix.  Memories 👍👍

"Heaven is for Real was a wonderful story. I had seen Colton when he was 3 or 4 years old on TBN. His story was so interesting to hear a young boy tell his story about being on Jesus's lap, meeting his sister, and grandfather. How so wonderful that he was still able to go and walk with Jesus and all he meet.  The young girl that drew the picture of Jesus was also amazing. For us to be able to hear and see two young children tell us about what happened to them when they visited Heaven. I pray that people got the message that was given, we are so lucky to have be able to share in their story<br />My Our Father and Son Jesus watch over all of us, God be with All🙏🙏✨✨😇😇✌️✌️👼👼<br />Sista Brenda aka Peaches🍑🍑✨🙏"

"I find it hard to enjoy a scary movie anymore. They are all predictable, the acting is sub-par, and I find myself picking apart the film rather than just enjoying it. This movie was one for my book! Just when you think you have it figured out... nope! Creepy factor was there too. Loved it 😈"

Here they are! 😎👍👏<br />I loved this movie & pieces of it have stuck in my mind for decades. I laughed so hard again after seeing it again on TCM & rushed to find it here on Amazon. I’m so glad you have it! 😎👍👏"
I'm guilty of sympathizing with absurd characters. As a writer try to understand why men like Hannibal Lector ate people.<br /><br />When I learned the Germans cooked his baby sister and forced him to eat her I never judged him again as ‘evil’.<br /><br />Seeing this movie commingled in a trilogy finale’ in Glass realize I'm still in empathy mode.<br /><br />I really like this movie. Very entertaining despite being disturbing. Understanding the character makes me unafraid. Empathetic. Understanding. Rooting for hope. Regardless of the traumatic likelihood things won't end well.<br /><br />⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💯

"Amazing movie. Complex as heck. James McAvoy deserves an award for all the faces he put on for this movie. This exaggerated take on Disassociative Identity Disorder/ DID is very interesting 🤔 I highly suggest watching Unbreakable, then Split & lastly Glass. Together they weave an intriguing and alternate perspective on everyday people."

Terrible movie stigmatizing Dissociative Identity Disorder. WE ARE NOT HORROR MOVIE TROPES! There's sooo much wrong with this movie. It perpetuates the myth that DID is a dangerous Disorder. It's gross. It's abelist. It's not based in reality. Movies such as this are SO damaging to the DID community. It needs to STOP 🤬

I first saw this movie when I was a kid back in the '80s on a local TV station around 1:00 in the morning it was during the holiday Christmas season. I fell in love with this crazy movie and I haven't seen it since until I saw it on TNT in the 1990s. This is a very campy crazy holiday Christmas movie from the 1960s it is not for everyone but if you are into a silly good goofy time then you going to love this movie it wasn't meant to be taken seriously and if you try to take it seriously you missing the point. 😆

"Read the book and loved it! And yes the movie 🎥 is different but I loved the actors in it! I did like Anna in the movie better than the book... Emily blunt is fantastic.. and though 'tom watson' is a ****hes a hottie!! My only problem was that it was New York and not in england... would have love that scenery, but I do love New York! I'm glad I read the book and bought the movie!"
"I will give it two stars because it was a movie that had potential. But really, it is just the same tired Hollywood formula... that falls flat... and has too many moving parts and directions, it is incredibly difficult to even successfully follow this and the slight hiding (with camera angles) of the nanny's secretin lover and the &#34;blurring&#34; technique of the initial attack under the walkway is such the typical Hollywood trick, that you end up getting frustrated and ultimately bored with everything that is going on. You have no sympathy for any of the charatersup  (ok, maybe sympathy for the nanny) but as far as everyone else is concerned... I was left thinkingredients &#34;who cares?&#34; And the whole exchange with Emily Blunt's character and the psychiatrist... I mean give me a break. When she asks &#34;oh... you have an accent... where are you from?&#34; And he answers, &#34;I am an American Citizen!&#34; I mean givery me a break! A little bit too sensitive for a licensed PHD... don't you think? Just to finish up.... artists and nyc Manhattanits will love it... but me... I'll pass (oh yeah... one more witty one linereason from the movie)... when the roommate of Emily blunt learns that she got fired and is only taking the train back and forth into nyc... she exclaims, &#34;this is how you are spending you alimony? On train tickets to no where?&#34; That lines sums up the stupidity of the movie.... rent at your own risk.😣"
There’s some parts with sexual situations that make it a little uncomfortable to show to some viewers.  It’s definitely slapstick with a crazy ending 😃

Must view!! Excellent 😊 I throughly enjoyed this. Learning about a female sniper in that point in time in history was incredible.  The subtitles were a little annoying but well worth the effort.  Great historical importance.

"I love it! Packaged great and played like a dream. I bought this for myself 🤣 I’m 33. I watched this on VHS as a kid and when my parents went through an ugly divorce, we lost everything. So when I found the DVD, I knew I had to have it. Bonus… my kids now love it!"

The visuals were great! 😀 However the storyline was awful! There was no plot. Some of the acting was just bad! The only good parts of the movie were when the guys were dancing.

"I’m afraid the low ratings claiming this movie has such a bad or lack of story are missing the entire point in the first place. 😂 It’s almost like a male watching an “adult film” for the great acting.<br /><br />Women (and gay males) don’t really get a lot of films with a desired centerpiece like this. Most movies have a focal point of females when it comes to sexuality and intimate scenes. This is a very nice change. It also gives women like myself a taste of what we cannot access (meaning - people like myself who have zero strip clubs in existence near us) and able to watch in the comfort of our own home.<br /><br />If you’re watching for a great, rich plotline this movie is not for you. But if you’re watching for a good time and some good eye candy..by all means, I highly recommend!"

"Look. When I say the words, “captain underpants,” what do you think of? A middle aged balding man in nothing but his undergarments? NO! You think of captain underpants. Worlds greatest hero of ALL. TOME. This movie far surpasses avengers info to war and all marvel movies as a hole combined. The charming dialogue and wonderful characters really add character and charm to this film. I saw this movie back in 2003 with my family consisting of 47 brothers and 1200 sisters. I love 💕 captain underpants the first epic movie. I would love to see a dog man movie where the dog is man. I think this is the greatest greasiest movie of all time. From, sincerely, best wishes,."

I liked the suspense of the movie but didn't like having to read the screen for almost the entire movie to know what they were saying. Great storyline just hated having to read the subtitles. Wasn't happy with the ending. Was one I should have rented instead of buying. I'm actually glad I didn't see it in the theatre. With my poor eyesight I never would've been able to follow along. 🙁😕😶

"I love all three John Wick movies.  However, John Wick 3 is the Best👍🏽"
"Lots of action! Hopefully JW4 will have less of the creepy high table lady and even more action, if that’s possible! 😂"
What's not to like about John Wick or Keanu Reeves? If you enjoyed the first two you will definitely like this one. It full of all of the action that was in one and two. Enjoy! 😉
Great movie! So worth the money and wait! Probably my favorite John Wick movie yet!😃👍🏻👍🏻
I heard so many people complaining that it was too much fighting and not enough back story. IF YOU WATCHED #1 & 2 you don’t need anymore of a story.<br />JOHN WICK IS WHERE ITS AT!! The whole movie to the very last minute was worth it! The 4th should definitely be the winning result and a great ending to the Wick movies! 🙌🏻

Blu-ray and 4K UHD both work great.<br /><br />Don't assume the 4K UHD doesn't work if you tried it in your Blu-ray player and you got an error message.<br /><br />Make sure you are playing the 4K UHD disc (disc 4) on a 👌4K Blu-ray player👍or it won't play at all... at least it wouldn't on my old Sony Blu-ray player.<br /><br />When I put it in my Panasonic 4K UHD Blu-ray it worked fine.<br /><br />Rating's for the disc not the film...obviously.

"What a wonderful breath of fresh air in a dominant entertainment culture where everything is dark, neurotic and violent. So cute, fantastic animation, and basic storyline. Some people go all political about China and Nepal setting. Really? This movie is really great and is completely apolitical. It’s a cartoon, not a geopolitical documentary about international relations. Sheesh, get over yourselves. Great for kids! 👍🏻👍🏻"

"I received the package ahead of Amazon's 'estimated arrival', So that's a plus! The Dvd is a gift for a Sister of mine, who thinks it's just not a ThanksGiving holiday; without the Macy's parade & watching 'The March of The Wooden Soldiers' movie!!! It was a Childhood Memory for my Siblings & I. She's wants to pass this on to her family now! Thanks Sooo Very Much for Always being On Time Amazon!!! 😃"

"I agree with the review by Joseph Ardine. I'm sorry I didn't read the reviews a little more closely before I rented it. I just assumed well, horror movies usually get a good amount of bad reviews so I will just ignore them like I usually do. But I couldn't believe what I stumbled into. How is this Wrong Turn ? It's nothing like wrong turn, and as I'm watching I'm thinking to myself ""boy, movies sure have changed in less than 20 years."" It's a ridiculous movie, a stupid premise, completely silly plot and story. And where ARE the inbred killers? Isn't that what we watch Wrong Turn for?? What the heck???!!! I don't mind when politics skew how some tv and movie shows are written but holy hell...keep it out of my horror movies. 🤢🤮🤬😭😒 It feels like they are trying to trick us into watching by giving it the name of a well-known horror movie, even though it is NOTHING like the other ones. It really should be given a completely different name (like Garbage or something) and they should be more transparent about what we're getting into! 😡🤬"

"Full disclosure, the movies great and it’ll pull your heart strings. I’m writing this review and giving it a one star though to save the people who love their dog as much as I do. I rarely cry in life; I cried >4 times watching this. This was hard. Ever since watching this movie, I think about life through my dogs eyes everyday. I can’t imagine life without him, and ever since watching this movie I think about the different stages he will go through, and ultimately when he gets old. It’s heart breaking. Leave to go on vacation? Instantly think of this movie and how he’ll miss me. He does something bad? Can’t be mad at him because he won’t be here forever. I’ve grown soft because of this movie. There is no amount of money I wouldn’t spend to make sure he lives as long as I do. Watch and be prepared to have your life changed forever 🐕."

"Just as I remembered it as a little girl.  For all those who didn’t like it, it was a wonderful magical tv special for us back then.  There was no CGI or  animation just a special story for young girls to imagine what it would be like to be a princess 👑.  Thank you for the memory.  For a brief time I was back in my living room dancing and spinning in my nightgown as a little girl. ❤️"

"Just as I remembered it as a little girl.  For all those who didn’t like it, it was a wonderful magical tv special for us back then.  There was no CGI or  animation just a special story for young girls to imagine what it would be like to be a princess 👑.  Thank you for the memory.

"I purchased this blu-ray in attempt to refresh my memory in anticipation of the new *Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure* at Disney World! I have seen this movie on various occasions over the past 14 years-but I really wanted to view the movie again, so I could distinguish any similarities between the movie and the ride. Blu-ray was authentic-I was hoping it came with a slipcover, though. Worth a watch at this price, a true culinary caper🐭"

I love anything Hobbit but so disappointed this movie weighed far from the storyline of the book. Overall ok as a movie but for Tolkien lovers 😭😭😭

"Please do a better job labeling the sequence— 1st, 2nd, 3rd. The titles are not intuitive and I had no idea why Bilbo was hanging around dwarfs as I was already half way through the second part. Luckily, my wife checked her email and promptly notified me across the world before I ruined the end 😒"

Bought this movie when they took it off of Netflix since it is one of my all time favorite if not my favorite movie of all time. Now I can watch it anytime of the year(which I already did) and on repeat for the holiday season. Best purchase so far and if you haven’t seen it I recommend you do it will easy become one of your favorites 😊

I forgot a lot about this movie and as a ripe child only 21 years ago when I saw the trailers with Jim in full Grinch makeup he terrified me. I love the callbacks to the og animated movie and the book. Very good time with my bebe 💕

I really love the history.. all the Fundamental aspects of this movie.. it was very simplicit. I feel as though it took me back in that time for Neil Armstrong's journey to the moon.. and the fact how it also explained his private life as well through his life life events .I also love the Soundtrack!!😊

I loved the story and how defensive it made the NTSB!!<br />It’s a great feel-good movie after all of the 9/11 tragedy. A real pilot did something heroic in NYC and saved a lot of people’s lives...he wasn’t selfish...he shared the credit with EVERYONE that helped...which is what REALLY made him stand out among his peers!! 😳😳😳

Heard so much about this movie. How great and all. But found it boring. To much talking no action Was bored half way into the movie. If you like a classic with no action this is for you. Enjoy 😊

It's not terrible. It's got action and keeps me interested. I have not read book so I cant rate based off that. I'm sure the book is WAY BETTER. They usually are.<br />I disliked the olden days plot. The fact women were so powerless and disrespected. Two of my favorite actors are in it. Leading red head from Poldark! Love her! Shes a really good actress. Also I'd of liked to see the scientific guy with the telescope a little more. I like him from his role in Once Upon a Time. (Not good at remembering names and spellings so hope you all can understand the acting cast I'm speaking of.😁)<br />I'm confused why only 3 episodes is this another one episode a week thing? Which sucks by the way and is starting to really make me unplug my subscriptions.

"👎This movie was ridiculous! A horribly inaccurate depiction of biblical text. Just typical Hollywood taking way to many ""artistic"" liberties with what most people find sacred. They could have had a beautiful and epic film of the amazing story & intriguing characters, but chose cheap visuals, inaccurate storylines and wrote the characters as uninteresting and  unsympathetic. Their depiction of God as an angry and demonic looking little boy, was both weird as well as sacrilegious! A mockery and insulting to a person of true faith!"

"I loved this movie! Our preteen wanted to go see this really badly so I bucked up and took him to the theatre. I did not expect it to be good at all, but I am so glad that I was wrong!<br /><br />It is a pretty funny movie with a good story line. I’m glad they brought in the original ghost busters for this movie too. I was excited to make my husband watch it with me when it became available to purchase on Amazon. He really liked it too! We both are fans of Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Things and Paul Rudd (hellooooo, sexiest man alive 2021😉) so we were excited to see that the movie had them both in it."

"I was never a Winnie The Pooh fan not really sure why? But after watching this movie I have absolutely changed my mind.  I have problems sleeping and usually need background noise and this has been on my list.  The songs are catchy,  Winnie the Pooh is well “silly ol bear” and I fall asleep  and wake up in a great mood.  I have been watching at least 3x /night since purchasing and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wholesome and just silly movie to watch pretty much everyday if you’d like 🥰"

"This is a creature feature -- and the monsters are fanged, spiked, and terrifying. Expect guts being blasted everywhere. I expected a cheesy sci fi film, but in the end I found it a bit entertaining. There is Lots of green alien blood and missing limbs. There is action, humors, sci fi, war, and some warm emotional moments. Overall, a nice paced film with a decent ending as far as a sci fi film can go. Overall, characters are from all walks of life and make positive contributions with the skills they have, including women who are assured leaders and kids who love science.<br />Not for younger kids, or people who are a bit squeamish. Parents should also know that there is foul language as well. 👽👽👽"

"Once you employ the necessary ""suspension of disbelief"", really good movie & truly fantastic special effects/CG. Chris Pratt & everyone else great. Literally bawled with laughter at ""Conspiracy Santa""  omg!!🤣<br />Def worth watching & ignore the Negative Nasties w/no lives."

"I liked it!! Chris Pratt is excellent (duh always) J.K. Simmons awesome (again duh).  Sam Richardson (Charlie) love him! Action, intensity, special effects GREAT.<br /><br />Story has a couple holes, writers 🤨 but really what Sci-Fi movie doesn't?<br /><br />Overall a FUN RIDE must see Sci-Fi"

"Absolutely Fantastic! It has been forever since I enjoyed an action movie. Going to watch again and again. Wish it was available on DVD. Hey Amazon, give Josh Peck a chance. He would also be fantastic in a good movie. Anywho, this movie didn’t have sex, just a great story and edge of your seat action with some humor. For added bonuses, watch while on treadmill. 😂"

How anyone could call this movie boring is beyond me 🤔my heart was beating in overtime  all the way through😳 and clutched a pillow over my face  more than once 😬this movie had a fantastic cast~Chris Pratt is Always good…I’ve been a fan of his since Park & Rec…Loved seeing Sam Richardson from VEEP…Yvonne Strahovski of The Handmaids Tale…Betty Gilpin from Nurse Jackie and the versatile J.K. Simmons…The ENTIRE cast was phenomenal 👍Perfect summer action popcorn flick with a lot of heart and humor tossed in too-appreciate the powers that be for putting this out on prime… instead of making this an exclusive theaters-only movie…SMART choice suits👍👍Pratt proves yet again why he’s THE best choice for ANY studio to make $$$….he knows how to give us GREAT movies!

"Even though this reminds me of Star Troopers (also a great movie) this movie was REALLY great, it's worth the 2:20 minute length. It covered all the questions I had: time paradox, how the aliens got there for being a savage race, the technology they used, and some other minor questions.  You really have to pay attention to the beginning of the movie because it is critical information for the end. Plus, main characters father looks freaking hot as hell (spoiler alert😏), even I was surprised."

It has a 2021 “Independence Day “ connection with the alien invasion. How they  depicted the plot in the future is rather short but will keep you in suspense. Had some heart to heart moments…..I enjoyed it overall 👍

"I asked my hubby to watch it and let me know what he thought about this movie, and he did. The following morning, I found his comment on my whatsApp:<br />""[23:05, 7/3/2021] Edward-J.: I can tell you you won’t like this 200% Hollywood computed special effects unending 200 bullets a minute gun shooting movie.<br />[23:07, 7/3/2021] Edward-J.: I do not want to give away the ending but the good guy defeats the evil aliens. Didn’t see that coming 🤣🤣🤣""<br />So much for that, I think this sums it up nicely! Do I need to say I feel no urge whatsoever to lose any sleep in order to watch it, too?"

"It was just okay. We love SciFi programs, but this one was slow, predictable & I was loosing interest in the middle. It was a cross between ‘Aliens’, ‘Edge of Tomorrow’, & ‘Starship Troopers’ with a bit of ‘Looper’ thrown in. We kept it going & I got interested in it again at the end. There are a small hand full of actors that I will watch no matter the movie, JK Simmons is one of them. We noticed that he’s been working out, check out his arms 💪🏻."

It’s an okay movie. The plot is slow and trite. But the aliens are cool and the computer graphics too. Makes a decent option for a regular movie night at home. 🍿

"After watching this whole movie I am still struggling to understand how with almost 4k respondents this movie received a 4 star review.  Granted if you like Alien and Independence Day, both movies I do like, this movie seems like a perfect fit.  The premise is very similar, the action is well executed, and the casting is actually pretty good.  Taken on it own it is a pretty okay HEA alien invasion movie told from the human perspective.  However, you will seriously need to suspend your scientific knowledge be and practically to focus solely on the good guy humans must win.<br /><br />*********Slight spoilers***********<br /><br />I'm not sure that they even employed anyone within the scientific community as a technical support person which is a shame given the amount of biological and quantum physics proposed with this much less the common sense part that says hey why don't we train people, stock up on, eliminate the scource, etc. way earlier...no wonder you have a massive mortality rate...it's called cannon fodder.  I hate guns, and couldn't tell you where a safety is on an AK so handing me one and throwing me In front of aliens with no training...yep zero to dead in 60 seconds.  Which is why I spent so much of my time laughing or rolling my eyes.<br /><br />Seriously the only saving grace in the movie was the sidekick doctor, CGI well done, and Chris Pratt's physique 😁."

I enjoyed this movie! I love Chris Pratt and enjoy pretty much anything he is in but it wasn't just him that made the movie. The aliens were some of the scariest I've seen and I didn't get bored. 👍

What a movie! Thia was action from beginning to end. Imaginative and unique. All actors did well and the dialogue was pretty good. Some cheesy lines but overall the movie was fantastic. I loved it and even though our expectations were low we found it really cool. The CG was AWESOME and we loved the story. It was clean (aka zero sex) BUT it is war and graphic with fighting and the aliens. Overall 👏👏👏

"This movie was a sci-fi thriller of a lifetime. At every turn you kept trying to figure out how they are going to get out of a bad situation and, how will the human species survive.<br /><br />I love the fact that this movie was not very predictable and the storyline is pretty incredible. It takes a very creative mind to come up with something like this.<br /><br />I gave this movie five stars because it kept my adrenaline pumping and there were so many unexpected twists and turns 👍"

"We could only watch about a half an hours worth  due to the horrendous/dreadful sound inadequacies. During the “speaking” parts I had to pump up the volume (I self checked my hearing just in case) whilst during the action sequences I had to lower it back down due to ear popping volumes. I don’t know whether the sound person(s)/department had been on some kind of medication as I found his/her/their contribution to be about as much use as an door eye spy hole on Stevie Wonder’s front door.<br />As for the film content, the plot/story line was ok I suppose from what we saw of it but I got the feeling that the producers were relying on effects to wow audiences rather than a genuinely good story.<br />Sorry about this review but everybody to their own I believe…please pass my Wife’s and my best wishes to the sound department/editors and we sincerely hope they get the loving attention they deserve 👍"

"Watched this on a date night with the hubs. I had already read some not so great comments about this movie, so I didn’t know what to expect, but since we have also seen movies that we thought were HUGE pieces of crap win tons of accolades and awards in past years, we went ahead and gave it a shot. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all, right?<br /><br />Were there some things that would not have been realistic in real life, like crashing to onto the earth at full speed, with an unrefrigerated, unprotected glass vial in the main character’s hand, which is the ONLY vial in the entire universe to prevent this horrible war in the future, and the vial doesn’t break? Undeniably yes. But..It was BADASS! Lots of ugly aliens, lots of shooting at them, great acting and cast, great special effects. If you are the type who enjoys merely being a critic instead of just immersing yourself in the experience and enjoying it for what it is, pure entertainment, (which in this case, is basically Starlord kicking alien ass and great special effects, without the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy 🤩) you may want to skip this. But if this kind of thing is your jam, get some popcorn, start this up and enjoy the show! 😊"

"This IS a thoroughly enjoyable film. It is a heartwarming story with lots of exciting science-fiction action! The plot is interesting and engaging due to the very high stakes for the main and supporting characters! I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat a few times. This is not for the twitters who came here just to attack a fun film for normal actuale humans to enjoy: with zero WAF stupidity.<br />🤗 Critics hated nearly all the films of Stanley Kubrick, but loved The Last Jedi.🤪🤡💩 Critics are clowns."

"i really liked it! The beginning was a bit slow or generic but thats to be expected when the main event is seeing what the aliens look like. The pacing picked up and then I just couldnt take my eyes off of it. Im like “whos gonna live? Whos gonna die?” Just biting my nails. Sooo a few things to point out is that its a really great concept but the “how it happened” is very rushed. There are also some generic spots and it even seems really wacky once the science is explained. The acting talent is pretty good and…I LOVED seeing lots of diverse talent. A movie like this gave fresh faces opportunity to shine and thats dope. The special effects were great. The little warps they go through do seem kind of “kiddy” but its not too bad honestly. Theres a LOT of action that just keeps your heart-pounding. There is a “moral” to the story and if u dont like those then this isnt for you. Honestly, the beginning of this movie had a very “faith based/family oriented film” kinda vibe so it is very watchable for families—but this movie does what faith-based productions havent been able to do since the beginning of time💀💀💀💀 I think some reviews are low bc it is a generic alien war/time jumping/family film but ive seen WORSE like Battle LA or something like that. I like Chris Pratt but Im not biased. I actually had low expectations for this movie but it really surprised me. The CLIMAX y’all…whewwww!!!!!!! Please watch this for your next movie night! 🌈🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️"

Missing going to the movies. This movie made me feel like going to see a box office and that was amazing to be able to watch this quality story and film right from home. I missed this with not being able to go to movies. Thank you 😁😁😁

"This reminded me so much of Starship Troopers! 😍<br />But on top of the amazing effects and alien design, the damn family dynamic got me too 😭<br />When his daughter revealed that he had done to her, what his dad did to him, I lost it.  Cut deep, but I have some experience there. Felt that one! Ouch<br />I wish they had cut the 2 Cringe scenes in this movie though. The part where dude picked up the ""metal saw"" and killed the alien, and when the same guy plopped down next to dad and son at the end who were exhausted from fighting the queen.<br />Movie would have been 100% solid to me had they cut those parts.  Otherwise this movie is Gold. I'm gonna watch it a few more times this week for sure."

"Sci-fi fans will have a fun ride. Great pace, action, fun, scary, emotional, hearts. Don't listen to the Critics, they got an agenda with obvious bias, nitpicking and just ridiculous bunch of haters.<br />Just watch and enjoy the fun ride for 2 hours. Two thumbs-up 👍👍"

"Good movie, im surprised they let a white guy take the lead and he actually got to be straight but I guess that got to slide due to adding in the whole global warming agenda....or maybe thats just how incredibly desperate Hollywood has become.  🤣 Other than that I was pretty pleased with how ""wokefree"" it was. The creatures are pretty FREAKY! Creeped me out like those original Alien movies did 👍. However... the most unrealistic part for me was how stupidly painfully lacking in technology the governments were. You're time jumping people but still using silly old helicopters and shooting normal bullets... I mean come on... we ALL know the governments have long sat on insane next level tech they have to pin on ""aliens"" to help buy them time before some kind of ""disclosure"" happens as we slowly fall into a dystopic medical technocracy. The aliens suddenly don't seem too scary now huh?😜 Just wait till things really kick off with China... the govs will be forced to bring some of it out into the light and you'll see what I'm talking about... (kinda like how one of our military warships got ""swarmed by ufo's"" recently  😉)"

Pretty entertaining for a sci-fi flick on the 4th of July weekend. And for those who are giving one and two-star reviews...lighten up. Action. Drama. Comedy. And most important of all -- a tangible alien enemy that's hard to kill but satisfying when you do. I suppose that's one way to rally the entire human race around a common cause. 😬

Need someone to make and sell the Tybee Island Tshirt that Charlie wears…my hubby was attacked by jellyfish on Tybee…still 🧡that place tho!<br /><br />But yeah, this movie has action, ALIENS (white spikes), all the feelings, funny, Chris Pratt (1SG Dan Forester) , Mrs. Waterford from “The Handmaid’s Tale” (COL Muri Forester), JK Simmons (Conspiracy Santa/Grandpa), crazy explosions, I could go on but you get the idea… Just watch it🧡"

"Absolutely Fantastic! It has been forever since I enjoyed an action movie. Going to watch again and again. Wish it was available on DVD. Hey Amazon, give Josh Peck a chance. He would also be fantastic in a good movie. Anywho, this movie didn’t have sex, just a great story and edge of your seat action with some humor. For added bonuses, watch while on treadmill. 😂"

Like they say there are living beings inside electricity. What if a malevolent alien race found the living entities in our calderas and they decided to genetically manipulate them into a planet killing weapon and the spaceship from this movie was actually taking them off planet to fight a war when one of our long ago  ice ages instantaneously hit? 😕

"Honest moment: It's entertaining, but basic....but still entertaining. Idk where people get off with these extreme reviews touting Chris Pratt as ""The Action Star Of The Century And Blueprint For Life"" or completely lambasting Amazon's original content, but this movie is good and not great and here's why.<br /><br />Besides the obvious of the trailer being a great tease *wink, wink*, if you look at the cast, you can tell it's your standard Sci-Fi Action Movie with white leads (one being a woman, which is very clearly meant to emphasize diversity). However, I will say a unique trait is the pace of this film which is purposeful-neck-breaking speed. The benefit to this is it gives the action true urgency for the viewer and not just explosions and chaos for the sake of using up the expansive budget. The writing also supports the purposeful-neck-breaking speed, but also gives way to basic trait #2: awkward transitions because it's impossible to keep it up! Those of you who saw the movie know exactly what scene I'm talking about when I say it's great but just...weird timing to talk about this particular subject right now with everything going on 🤨."

"The title, trailer, and even cast inclined me to predict a shallow plot, with pointless action scenes and abused cliches.<br />Yet, I was treated to one of the most intriguing science fiction narratives I've seen. It was accompanied by actual drama that was original, and it made sense, of course under those unique circumstances.<br />The great acting, plot, and visuals covered nicely the holes in the story due to time limitations, and if this became a sequel, or even a prequel, it'll definitely have me hooked to see more. Job well done 👏."

No spoilers‼️<br /><br />Must watch. Unbelievably good 👍<br /><br />Chris Pratt did not fail to deliver another excellent movie to his fans. As a Sci-fi author the story was very well thought out and delivered.<br /><br />Appropriate for all ages.

"Good storyline with much potential, but unfolds dumb & what tried to be suspense was lost. Future =just go back farther & kill before, well they finally do & even that is done poorly bcz after poisoning a few they stopped & let the others 'awaken.... Duh don't stop.<br />Failed suspense about adult-version daughter dying bcz everyone knows the future wasn't yet reality.<br />Script may have worked if it was our (audience' s) first time travel, but that ship sailed long ago.<br />🌹Thankful for the fast fwd button 💃i would've given up on it 🌹 very thankful i don't have to feel cheated bcz it's $0 fee<br />🕊 PEACE 💜 BLESSINGS 👼"

"This movie was awesome!!  Really enjoyed it!  I love Chris Pratt!  He's such a fun actor to watch and his movies are always enjoyable.  This movie is action packed from the very beginning!!  It had funny moments, which is ALWAYS great, sentimental moments, just enough to appreciate the scene and full of action!!  We decided to turn the volume up higher than normal so we can have the full effect of an action/adventure movie which caused one of our surround sound speaker cover to fall off the ceiling and add a little jump scare to our movie experience!  Lol, it was great!  I would recommend this movie to anyone and would definitely watch it again (with the volume turned up 😉) again!"

"I thought it was pretty good. I like movies where the theme is fresh & not wash, rinse, repeat. This is something different & the cast more or less did a good job in their respective roles. The aliens are pretty awesome & the twist at the end, even though  I guessed it was still an interesting take on their arrival. So over all a good movie 🎥"

"It's going to be a challenge to write anything about this movie that isn't at best catty, or at worst outright mean...so I'll just learn to live with guilt and move on.<br /><br />😙<br /><br />In a word this movie was....wait...okay, there is no word for rolling of the eyes that I'm aware of, but if there is, that's the word I'd use.<br /><br />No more that 15 minutes into this formulaic, semi-ripoff of the ""Alien"" movies I was sure I had 85% of the story predicted, and I was right.  From the simple, expected and totally obvious plot twists, to the fight against a viscious queen (and not the kind that throws a drink on you at a Pride parade btw, though just as shrill).  The bad guy aliens, I thought, we're almost comedic.  You could just see a bunch of Hollywood creatives trying to 'out-baddie' the baddest baddies they could think of.  The outcome feels more like a Christmas tree that someone didn't know when to quit adding ornaments too, but with a lot of teeth, so I guess I like an overdecorated dentist's Christmas tree.  Seriously, I had a moment of vague recollection of slapping this body part and that body part onto a potato when I was child and I nearly laughed at that moment.  The bad guys were overly dressed Misters Potato Head (Is that the actual plural for Mr. Potato Head?).  That was when the eye rolling engaged.  Follow up with boring, uncompelling characters and what the heck happened to Chris Pratt btw?  In just a few years he went from Guardians of the Galaxy hot stud to mom jeans wearing portly and creased 50 yr. old soccer dad.  THAT was way scarier that the Hollywood Build-a-Baddies ever were.  Sorry Chris.  At least you can say you were a super hottie.  Most of us just went from ""Meh"" to the portly and creased dude.  No glory days, so you still lucked out.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you want really compelling evidence about the disappointment of this movie (which I had looked forward to with eagerness), here it is.  With about 30 minutes left in the film, as it was right at the precipice of it's grand finale I decided that I was more interested in working on the excercises and studying I need to do as I'm working on learning to write code as a software developer.  I chose to write computer code and turn the movie off.  I NEVER choose to code before anything exceptperhaps tax preparation and colonoscopies.  I did, obviously go back to the movie later mostly because needed a sleep aid more than to learn how the dumb thing ended even though I already knew how it would end.  It was more like the compulsion to gawk at a roadside accident that desire to be entertained, which is lucky because I wasn't...entertained that is.

"It's going to be a challenge to write anything about this movie that isn't at best catty, or at worst outright mean...so I'll just learn to live with guilt and move on.<br /><br />😙<br /><br />In a word this movie was....wait...okay, there is no word for rolling of the eyes that I'm aware of, but if there is, that's the word I'd use.<br /><br />No more that 15 minutes into this formulaic, semi-ripoff of the ""Alien"" movies I was sure I had 85% of the story predicted, and I was right.  From the simple, expected and totally obvious plot twists, to the fight against a viscious queen (and not the kind that throws a drink on you at a Pride parade btw, though just as shrill).  The bad guy aliens, I thought, we're almost comedic.  You could just see a bunch of Hollywood creatives trying to 'out-baddie' the baddest baddies they could think of.  The outcome feels more like a Christmas tree that someone didn't know when to quit adding ornaments too, but with a lot of teeth, so I guess I like an overdecorated dentist's Christmas tree.  Seriously, I had a moment of vague recollection of slapping this body part and that body part onto a potato when I was child and I nearly laughed at that moment.  The bad guys were overly dressed Misters Potato Head (Is that the actual plural for Mr. Potato Head?).  That was when the eye rolling engaged.  Follow up with boring, uncompelling characters and what the heck happened to Chris Pratt btw?  In just a few years he went from Guardians of the Galaxy hot stud to mom jeans wearing portly and creased 50 yr. old soccer dad.  THAT was way scarier that the Hollywood Build-a-Baddies ever were.  Sorry Chris.  At least you can say you were a super hottie.  Most of us just went from ""Meh"" to the portly and creased dude.  No glory days, so you still lucked out.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you want really compelling evidence about the disappointment of this movie (which I had looked forward to with eagerness), here it is.  With about 30 minutes left in the film, as it was right at the precipice of it's grand finale I decided that I was more interested in working on the excercises and studying I need to do as I'm working on learning to write code as a software developer.  I chose to write computer code and turn the movie off.  I NEVER choose to code before anything exceptperhaps tax preparation and colonoscopies.  I did, obviously go back to the movie later mostly because needed a sleep aid more than to learn how the dumb thing ended even though I already knew how it would end.  It was more like the compulsion to gawk at a roadside accident that desire to be entertained, which is lucky because I wasn't...entertained that is.  But, good news, I'm sleepy now and can fall asleep counting little Potato Heads until I Zzzzzzzz.....<br /><br />Oh, yeah, without blowing the mystery of it all, don't be surprised if afterwards you find yourself humming the tune to ""We are Farmers, bum da dum de dum de dum"".

"We like the take on the alien creatures and their abilities etc. Christ Pratt, Yvonne, JK, and the rest of the cast was solid. Just a fun movie to enjoy with friends and fam. Even more captivating when you have a proper Atmos system and TV setup. I don’t really care much for those rating and critic sites. I just base it on how much I enjoyed watching a film/show. This was Ace and a lot of fun.<br />@primevideo @amazon please make more of these. And also Please make the big movies & shows Dolby Vision. HDR does not do this movie justice. 👍🏼"

"This movie is TERRIBLE. The plot is dumb, the characters are dumb, the ending is dumb and so is pretty much everything that comes before it.<br /><br />I went into this fully expecting it to be bad so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be worse than I’d imagined. (I think I drew the line at the main character - Doug? Dan? - suggesting that he’s going to go back in time to stop a future event from happening and THEN he’s going to travel to the future to save his daughter from that future event. . . . Exactly.)<br /><br />It was all so ludicrous it was laughable. Like, I literally laughed and frankly enjoyed myself. It had the compelling appeal of a blooper reel. If Troll 2 is your jam (it’s mine) then you should consider this film.<br /><br />Also, I’m throwing in the towel on Chris Pratt as a leading man. This film did not serve him. He is so diminished by the script and his own poor/lazy? acting that I really wondered how he’d headlined a Marvel film. And, the way he kept widening his eyes in several scenes made him look weird and confused as if he was trying to remember his lines and was terrified that he wouldn’t.<br /><br />Sam Richardson was great, as always. He was the only highlight of this film. And in the end, they gave him a buzz saw to kill one alien. 👀😩😂<br /><br />So, yeah. I don’t regret it but YOU might if you’re looking for a “good” movie."

This is a straight up fun and entertaining action movie. Story is clean and efficient and the cast makes it enjoyable. The movie follows a familiar genre so you can sit back and enjoy the action and some laughs from always fantastic Chris Pratt 😄 It would be a great July 4th weekend watch with friends and family on Amazon!!

"Overall  I enjoyed the movie, Are there some holes, some dumb decisions yes.  rather large alien army ant type creatures burst out decimating the world. We somehow build a worm hole device that goes back 30 years in the past, and ask for help.  The world sends all of their troops, and they all die????<br />  So send in John Q public draftee's with a full auto rile to fight, after 7 day orientation. ?????<br />  No mini guns, or hand grenades, or RPG's.  But carpet bomb the cities<br />  YES it's a standard disaster movie story we have seen 80 times so we all know how it ends (john dies)🤣🤣🤣"

This starts out gangbusters doesn't take long to get into the action. CGI was pretty good. The monsters seem like a mix of other monsters we've already seen but was still original. Then it kinda slows down going into explanations that kinda dragged out a bit. Then finishes strong with an ending that you thought was predictable but wanted it to end a certain way and it does. Its definitely worth watching. I was entertained. Is it worth a 2nd viewing ... yeah I would watch it again but I wouldn't it over n over like Endgame. 😎👍I hope Amazon gets into making more feature films. Their Prime Video format is so much better than any other streaming service. It's vastly superior to Netflix. Keep em coming Amazon!!!

"Classic fun summer movie! I don’t typically like action movies, but I felt this one went by so quick & was entertaining enough to keep my attention for the 2+ hours (which is difficult when you’re watching something at home).<br />These one star reviews are hilarious- people upset because it’s predictable, what alien war movie isn’t? People mad they’re not using weapons properly- you must be fun at parties 🙄 People mad it isn’t scary- it’s not supposed to be scary!  If you are in the mood for something fun, I recommend watching this film."

"Great movie over all and a really neat premise I personally hadn’t seen before. The monsters are unique and creepy (at least to me lol). There are a few plot holes though (hence the 4-stars) like, how did the dad/grandpa know the monsters could smell blood, hmm🤨?? VERY good special effects too! Amazon spent M.O.N.E.Y. on this one y’all and not just to hire Chris Pratt!😂<br /><br />Anything less than 4-stars is a tightwad critic or a thinly veiled white supremacist butthurt about seeing blacks and women on screen🙄. Watch it for yourself, definitely not a waste of two hours.👍🏾"

I Like Chris Pratt even though he's a MAGA 🧟‍♂️ Holy plot 🕳's!  but still fun an entertaining. Kinda Aliens meets Star Troopers.

"0 out of 5 stars. From the first minute it ruined all the tension of the movie and start to finish it was completely nonsensical, poorly written a terrible premise and a $200,000,000 failure. Whomever is saying 5 stars is being paid. This is a dumpster fire rolling downhill. They all have magical guns that have unlimited ammo and all the trained military in the world fails and yet the 3 blind mice save the day with the power of friendship and love...🤮 2 plus hours of huh? No way that's going to work, how'd that whole ship blow up from 10lbs of C4? And about 50 other ?s that will make you scream at your tv and probably rage quit before its over"

Such a fantastic movie! My husband and I loved it! Thanks for finally putting something out that is entertaining and not bogged down with current issues. Although I’m now scared this could totally happen so someone should check into that 🤣

I only watched this because of Spoonman Mike Mitchell who plays Cowan. He delivered (not only the 🍕 ) and bonus was the entire movie was super fun and entertaining. Classic summer blockbuster and really enjoyed watching it at home. Definitely recommend for some good old fashioned alien apocalypse fun.

"Overall, the movie was okay...won't watch it again, don't regret watching it.  Chris Pratt, as usually, was great...but the story had some pretty big holes in it and there were moments almost too cringe (over the top/absurd).  Watch it so you've seen it,  high five your fellow Chris Pratt buddies and move on with life.🤣"

Suspense full and action pack.<br />What I didn’t like was that aliens were so hard to died and they carry on their tentacles more bullets than the soldiers , they should carry granates or bombs to get rid of so many aliens , they were like spiders all over 😂😂"

I guess the message I got is Gen Z is so weak they need to figure out how to teleport Gen X and Babyboomers into the future to fight for them.  Was I close?  🙂

"Way too much cheese in this move and the hot topic now is that cheese is cancer!<br />I'm sure this director farts in a glass then sniffs it because this whole movie is self gratifying moments worse than the paramount show DISCOVERY! I still love DISCOVERY but let's be honest.<br />You can't burn the oxygen out of caves and expect humans to survive till the end of the movie🤯,,who let him do that and why it's stupid!<br />People voted for the stupid in charge so I can see why this movie is #1!  Have no hate for the actor's!"

"Great 5 star sci-fi time traveling alien flick! The low reviews crack me up, it’s like they didn’t know they were about to watch a sci-fi alien movie 🤣"

"Great science fiction movie that ranks up with the classic 2nd Aliens film. Very well written and excellent characterization. This is what the Aliens franchise should have been. Heart touching while being chock full of big budget blockbuster action and special effects. I sincerely hope Amazon is open to a sequel, the final conflict left questions that need to be answered. 👍"

This movie made me think..I definitely can see a debate on time travelling issues. We need a lot of explanation on these so call aliens...😂.  All the actors and actresses was wonderful .. Enjoy this movie in the dark with your Hue sync box light or Govee TV led ...AND don't forget the sound bar on high volume !!!!  Make this a movie night.

"I loved that movie<br />Just finished ❤<br />I have so many unanswered questions though about how their realization of what's in the present affected the future, and those who went to fight from the present to the future, in the end.<br />I need a sequel to explain that 😆"

"This movie was the most suspenseful and entertaining action movie, I've seen in a while. Too bad, the movie theaters are not opened at full capacity, this would have been a box office hit. A few things did not make sense, (like how did the vial not break when he travel...)Nope, it's a movie, no need to be petty.....The movie was able to connect emotionally with the audience, something a lot of movies failed to do lately. The action was on par and it kept the audience attention until the very end. Very good movie. 👍🏾"

"Liberals and aliens will give this low ratings. Cheesy fun, though entertaining on a heavily retreaded plot, but with a clever time-travel twist. Special effects and camera work were solid. Good, life messages throughout. I suspect the aliens are intended to represent modern-day liberals who are trying to destroy the future. 😏"

"(plotline sequencing twists and supposes alternate reality): If you watch the movie, afterwards, ask yourself if the daughter knew that he failed to actually prevent the alien invasion? - the movie just makes you fill-in that blank, because it ends with ""they all lived happily ever after"" we never address the ""reality"" that in 28 years, we KNOW the aliens still overrun the earth and their last hope clearly failed. If you rearrange the time sequencing properly, the movie ends with the daughter's last hope... having sent her father back... had failed... although if you're a hollywood optimist or someone who believes fate is fantasy, you can say they found/killed them all back in the present, and although one future experiences tragedy, there is another, new one, that does not.🎭  So if you leave your deep thinking cap at home, it's an AWESOME MOVIE and I needed this.  ;)"

"Loved it, here’s why. It kept me engaged, the action had me at the edge of my seat, the special effects (I constantly rate) in movies, was beyond great, the script was great with a few exceptions, it also had me laughing from time to time. I give this movie 5 stars. Shout out to all the supporting actors/actresses. Thank You!!!! 😘"

I loved this movie and I'm not a huge sci-fi fan. Very entertaining which is why I watch a movie. Reviewers who slammed the legitimacy of the facts...get over it- it's a sci-fi movie...Love it and would recommend 👌

My family and I really liked this film. Scariest sci-fi flick I’ve seen in a while. Great creature design! Totally entertaining! Don’t listen to the exaggerated “stupid” or “awful” reviews. Judge for yourself 😃

Aside from all the woke virtual signaling and Diversity crap they had to shove global warming  and vaccine propaganda down your throat. Chris Pratt looks like they darkened his hair to make him appear less white. 🤣Starship troopers  but lamer.

"I like Chris Pratt and all his other films but seriously!? This film lacked. There were parts that made me feel awkward, parts that made me feel confused, parts that made me cringe, question and sigh with utter disappointment. Some scenes had more than one feeling (or all) 🙄. Some parts I feel they tried too hard and others they didn't try hard enough (Actors, writers, director).<br />I dont usually feel impressed (or unimpressed) to write a review, positive or negative,  but after watching this film I truly felt the need to leave a bad review because I am so tired of them just spilling out films careless of quality just so they can make an extra buck. I want REAL entertainment!"

"Ah yes, the old ""there's a global war 32 years in the future and they need to go back in time to draft soldiers 50 at a time."" Obviously that's easier than going back in time 32 years and telling everyone to make more babies.🙄<br />Otherwise, it was actually a lot of fun."

"🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<br /><br />- Great storyline. It all comes full circle.<br />- Wrapped up loose ends.<br />- Solid pacing for all 3 acts of the film.<br />- Had me on the edge of my seat pretty much throughout the whole movie!<br /><br />Albeit each character had their moment to shine, what stood out to me was the father & son moments.<br />The dichotomy between MCM (Marvel Cinematic Multiverse) actors; Pratt & Simmons is on point. A terrific combo that I didn't know I needed. Haha.<br />They shared a couple emotional scenes, and Simmons landed a few cheeky jokes that are sly enough to go over your head, unless you know the reference.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that this crazy mashup of a family film & an alien shooter...<br />Works, it just works... trust me. Lol<br /><br />I REALLY enjoyed it! Hopefully you all will too!"

As a Vet that after multiple years separated and now fat am now challenged with the thought of this possibly happening and getting re-recruited but now completely out of shape and dying in the first couple of seconds...let alone sticking that 10 foot landing lol ankles shattered 😅 excuse me as I go cry in the gym to a picture of Chris Prat. Oh and yeah great movie.

I have watched this twice because I love to rewatch and see things I missed the first time around...but it just mainly made us all 😂 laugh! So for entertainment value I have it 3 stars but overall it was a hysterical mess...no rope! Haaa...best editing ever! :: Sarcasm:: 🤣😂🤣

Action part is ok if you don’t have anything else to watch.<br />Everything else is just awful. If you don’t understand how time works don’t use it for a story. Most of the time I was just sitting in front of TV with 🤦‍♀️

Seriously surprised me with how good this film was. Chris Pratt did an amazing job as always & the rest of the actors as well. The aliens were fantastic..👌 The best aliens ever created in my opinion. Just an all around great movie. I definitely recommend this for anyone who likes sci-fi..😍👾

"Chris Pratt did amazing in the movie. He broke out of his roll of just being a humor character. Yes he was fun but also was he down to earth and not making jokes the entire time or being dorky. He got serious and did amazing at it! The movie was a bit all over the place but I reminded me of war movies of course with a main character taking most of the time. It dealt with issues of PTSD, family, government, scifi, and all rapped neatly up in a few hours. I've read a few reviews that were a bit critical for no real reason other than what I can see as superiority complexes believing they know better. Either way if you want something to just pass the time and enjoy packed with Action, suspense, and a dash of human conflict then watch this! Thank you for your time in reading this and I hope you enjoy the same way I did! 😁"

"I thoroughly enjoyed this film!  🤩<br /><br />It incorporated multiple themes into the plot:  Dan’s search for purpose, the importance of science for a doomed world, father-son & father-daughter conflict, father abandonment, the power of forgiveness, the strength of a father’s love, climate change, women empowerment, and diversity & inclusion.  😌<br /><br />I liked that the time travel alone was dope and deadly. 😯 The aliens were wickedly scary, truly one of the best aliens I’ve seen in a film.  Not only were they super fast, and could shoot spikes but they could swim like dolphins and even hoover in flight like squirrels.  😲<br /><br />There were multiple ‘climactic’ action scenes after the initial time jump that kept it from dragging.  There was enough heart-pounding suspense (music was on point) and fantastic action to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Really good cinematography (photography angles). 😎<br /><br />There were some surprising reveals. One more so than the other because the fast-paced action kept my mind from speculating.<br /><br />Throughout you can tell there was a real emphasis on diversity and inclusion - party, classroom, platoons, final fighters.  As a proud black man, I really appreciated that. ✊🏾 Especially that the two black comic relief wasn’t just funny, but both were borderline geniuses. 🤓<br /><br />Last but certainly not least, as a father to four amazing girls, I love movies that portray strong kick-ass women.  😍 There were so many to choose from including the Colonel, Lt. Hart, Diablo, and who can forget the baddest of them all - the female alien.<br /><br />My critique would be that the 3/4 mark to the end felt a little rushed.  Tons of action, but maybe slow it down a bit to ensure that the audience is still tracking.  Also, in the end not sure where the hell Charlie came from. 😂<br /><br />As a person seeking that ‘greater purpose in life,’ this movie resonated with me personally.  It highlighted the devastating impact on kids when their fathers leave the home. 😢  Dan’s final words were one of my favorite quotes: “I’m never going to leave her. I’ll never leave this family. Because my best future…was always right in front of me.”<br /><br />I heard that many other critics were pretty harsh, but they all can kick rocks.  🤨 Go in with an open mind and enjoy yourself.  Highly recommended! 👍🏾"

"Worth watching, still! OUTSTANDING action and storyline but cringey cliché dialogue, unrealistic use of characters, and empty character personalities that create no connection to the audience.<br /><br />Only Sarah from Chuck fit the role for this film well. Everyone else is known for good acting, but this cast was awkwardly chosen and placed. If it wasn't for Chris Pratt, this movie wouldn't have gotten enough traction or views. Giving it 3 stars only bc the action and cinematography was above and beyond, probably one of my favorites ever. But the way the dialogue and characters were written, it felt like a toddler wrote out the fantasy yard games they created and played with their friends. Wayyyyy too cliché.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /> and the main character's choices were unfitting for the role he was supposed to be in. I understand the meta message that the war is a social and interpersonal one between people close to you, but suck it up and do your job, dude. 😅you were trained, you know to put things aside and get this mission done."

"I love movies that has anything to do with aliens and UFOs and this movie did not disappoint! I initially thought it was going to be a really bad ""B"" movie but it turned out to be really good! The acting was great and the characters were very likable. I laughed, I cried, and I was terrified! I had to pause the movie a couple times though because my anxiety was through the roof, lol. I was also on the edge of my seat for a good part of the movie. I hadn't seen a really good alien movie for awhile so I'm glad I decided to watch it!! 2 thumbs up! 👍👍"

"Our whole family enjoyed it. The aliens were scary, the CGI was on point and the acting was great. The point of a movie is to be entertained (so please plot hold pokers sit back down).  There was laughter, sadness and some creeped out scary parts. It’s not easy to pull off an entertaining movie for the whole family, but they did 🙌🏼 Watching it again right now 😁"

First off a film review should be about the film and your experience with whether or not you enjoyed it. Political views and preferences have no business here. That being said I didnt immediately watch this. I am a Chris Pratt fan but time travel? Aliens? I thought it would be an overblown CGI nightmare.<br />I was very wrong. It didnt lay too heavy on tech and go too far into how they manage to figure out how to travel in time in such a short amount of it. Which kept the belief of it being held together by a gum and chicken wire believable. And it kept you on that edge of uncertainty throughout the whole film.<br />With the action being plentiful but not over done it kept each encounter at a breakneck speed. The first time I saw the white spikes it was unnerving in its design. It definitely looked made to do exactly what it was doing.<br />I could go on and on but I will just say that it doesnt just ride intense action the whole way. Plenty of heartfelt and compassionate moments. J.K. never disappoints as well as Sam Richardson with his comedic take on things.<br />I have to say that I am as satisfied as the Volcano kid when he had his moment(which had me 💀) coupled together with the moment of satisfaction when the female met her splattery end. Which is pretty darn satisfied. Highly recommend!

J.K. never disappoints as well as Sam Richardson with his comedic take on things.<br />I have to say that I am as satisfied as the Volcano kid when he had his moment(which had me 💀) coupled together with the moment of satisfaction when the female met her splattery end. Which is pretty darn satisfied. Highly recommend!
A well written story that is worth your time!<br />I hope for a sequel.<br />It's kinda a tear gerker.<br />Just watch it 😁

"A+ 👏🏼. I really enjoyed the tomorrow war. It pretty much has everything you want in an action movie. Suspense, wow scenes, non-stop action, some laughs and a few heart tugs. Check it out 👍🏼"

"We enjoyed this movie!!  Chris Pratt does an excellent job of bringing all the feels.  We didn't know the premise of the movie, had no expectations going in.  It had a great story line, lots of action and a terrific cast.  Watch it!! It won't disappoint 🙌  A movie is supposed to entertain, and this does."

"I like the movie, imaging being able to jump 30 years into the future to help fight a war against aliens 👽.  The fact that we crack the time barrier was interested, but why after 30 years are we still using bullets? I thought after all these years, we would have advanced in weapons. Over the movie was very entertaining."

"Spoilers ahead...<br /><br />Wow.<br />I wanted to like this movie. I really did.<br />Some movies have plot holes and I can roll with a little bit of that, but my goodness, this was grandma's raggedy plot afghan that the dog got ahold of.<br />I was trying to suspend my disbelief about the many inconsistencies that came up in the first two thirds of the movie or so, but when dude jumps back with the vial in his hands cost his daughter her life and could save Humanity, he finds out that he can't go back and instead of mass-producing the toxin<br />(you know, like his future daughter told him he was the only one she could trust to do) he is all like darn I can't make it and take it back to the future. I had to turn the TV off in sheer disbelief and call a friend who had just watched it to vent. I mean, people got paid money to make this movie. Did anybody have the intelligence,  chutzpa, or job security, or whatever, to say, this makes no sense? I tried to start watching it again but now we're off on some tangent about volcanoes, and ash in your claws, and...🌪🐿🌪🐿🌪🐿🌪🐿🌪<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie."

"What a piece of crap, did they spend all their budget on the CGI monsters?! this movie is supposed to be set 30 years in the future?!! We have even better weapons and technology as of now than it’s being show in the movie, and don’t get me started with the whole traveling time concept and the logic used in this movie, no sense at all! Are the real Aliens monitoring their war beasts while they clear up the planet earth first? 🤷🏻‍♂️"

"It was absolutely thrilling. I appreciate them telling us key points to things that are basically taking place in our society. People on here giving bad reviews but missing the key points of the movie. It was very informative to me so I advise yall wake up!!! They put stuff in movies, tv shows, music, etc plain as day and people still don't get it 🙄 they think everything is for entertainment."

"Great movie! Found it engrossing and entertaining. Will watch it again with some of the family. Obviously has lots of action and some violence, while also touching. Must see. I also really like Chris Pratt even if he's a Trump supporter😬😉🤣..so a no brainer for me."

Awesome movie!🤩👍 I find lately it's harder to see a movie that either keeps my attention or surprise's me and this one did both.😁 Then again Chris Pratt has yet to let me down and don't forget the rest of the cast they all Rocked.😍💕

"There's obviously a lot of odd people commenting on this movie, because I'll never understand how you make this movie political simply because they mention the ice melting in Russia 🤦🏾‍♂️. Literally 5,000 scientists who are 5 million times smarter than you say the polar ice caps are melting. What's the problem with a movie using actually science??<br /><br />This movie was action packed from start to finish. Great storyline and acting. LOVED IT."

"I was blown away by script! It touched my heart...and that's rare with today's garbage!<br /><br />It had it all... a hero who lived an adventure...a beauty to save (his daughter & wife in this case)...and a vicious villain to fight!  Great stuff! And no major turn offs like TONS of PC crap that plagues Hollywood these days! There was some PC stuff popping up, but nothing like usual!<br />👍"

"I laughed, jumped, cried, and yelled noooo😭!  Also some of the visuals were just so cool. Like that one scene where he goes after ""someone"" right before he jumps back to reality and there is a mid air slow shot.....epic!👏"

"Excellent, excellent movie! For all you naysayers out there, kiss my ass! It was heartfelt, action-packed, and kept me on the edge of my seat.  It brought me to tears multiple times with the poignant story line.  Then with the comedy mixed in as well, it gave it an edge above the rest of these types of films/movies, by lightening the intensity of the battles and impending doom. All around an incredible movie, with a Rockstar cast and cinematography. I give it TWO Thumbs up! 👍🏻 👍🏻"

"I'm REALLY disliking all the politics and people attacking the movie because they don't like Chris Pratt. It's utter nonsense. This movie is a callback to the fun summer blockbusters of the 90s. It's pure escapist entertainment. You're not gonna get letchured too. You're not gonna be told that due to your skin color and gender (which may or may not exist in the first place) that you need to ""do better"". There's plenty of that in the world already. This is simply a fun movie that knows what it wants to say and says it very well.<br />This is NOT high art. It never intended to be. It's simply good ole fashioned fun. If relevant post modernist deconstruction is your thing, there's always Twitter. 🤷🏾‍♂️"

1st time I reviewed a movie but I was impressed by production of the movie. Kept me on my toes very suspenseful and the length of the movie was just right. Action and story on point. Big fan of Chris Pratt so I might be bias a bit. Good mix of action and emotional story. Amazon did a great job 👏🏽

"This is a 🎥 movie of a lifetime. It will go down as part of History.  Yes, fictional, but aren't most great movies fiction? This was an opportunity to place real life situations and symbolic meanings into a make believe world that could exist(one day). There is a message....we can and we will. The first syfy movie with real purpose that touched people all over the 🌎 world. Plus it was an awesome action thriller! LONG LIVE THE KING!"

One star for not embedding the wakanda language that they speak!<br />The movie is great and i do not wish for amazon to take away the kovie and reimburse me unless you guys release and updated movie with the subtitles other than that its a waste of $20 because you do lose some of the plot since we dont know what they are sating 👎

"Really like John Travolta.  I think he's an exceptionally fine actor.  However, I didn't care too much for this ""Battleground Earth"" His acting was top notch, as always, but  didn't  care for this movie. I didn't like the way the story line was carried out & think it fell kinda flat.  Could have used more time developing the characters & more personality & time invested in the main characters, i.e., the young couple & John Travolta's character. Watching the the film, it was hard to relate to them or know who they were supposed to be. 😦jlp"

"I've read the Dark Tower series at least a dozen times.  I enjoyed the video and appreciate how comically the book series wove it's way around and through the viewing; details which carried my mind to the novels..  The first half of the video is rich with detail and strong characters.  In the end it was a rush to the finish line.  A lot was left out, but not so much as to distort the telling of the tale.  I like it!😀"

"So I was excited to see a movie of the dark tower. I'm sorry that I was so disappointed. Where is the other major characters. If this was to mash up the whole trilogy in one movie. It has failed. I feel bad that Stephen king was OK with this, cause everything about this movie only touch's tinny snippets of what this story is all about. Please read the books before you go into this movie is awesome. I am so saddened that this was OK and the actors approved to play theses wrong roles. It makes me cry 😢😢"

Unfortunately the subtitles dont work 😭 but overall i love this movie"

"A close friend recommended this movie to me because we share a romantic fascination with scents. But regardless of that fascination, this movie was fantastic! The cinematography, acting, and dialog were all captivating. This movie, through the cinematography, romanticizes life in France during that era, as well as shows you the darker underbelly. It really showcases that none of the luxuries we enjoy come without someone we don’t see suffering.<br /><br />I would write a ton more, but I don’t want to spoil it for anyon reading this before watching the movie. All I want to say now before I go, is that the casting choices were perfect. The late Alan Rickman, and the marvelous Dustin Hoffman is in it. That alone got my attention 😂 Then you have John Hurt narrating...my God; I rented this movie through Amazon video; but I’m afraid that I must buy it on DVD 😂 Enjoy!"

"So this movie was a fun, Saturday afternoon flick. Best to watch it with the understanding that, yeah, it's gonna be a cheesy sci-fi movie from an earlier Era. But still fun - grab the popcorn and the kids (well maybe not the kids unless they can be open minded 😆) and enjoy"

No matter what the &#34;critics&#34; say, if I like it I'll watch it no matter what the reviews. Tom Cruise is not my favorite actor but I did enjoy his performance in this one. The it's worth a watch, like it or leave it, your choice.😀"

I am a sucker for this particular time period in history. The film was beautifully shot. Every actor in this film performed wonderfully. And having had a family grow up in England at that time. Well done! 👍

"I, like every 80s junkie is a sucker for nostalgia it seems.  This movie is no different. This movie is sentimental to me, I couldn't really tell you why but it is.  I remember being young watching this and wishing so much that Kenny Rogers would be my dad.  It made me see at a young age that men could be like him and I guess I wanted that, I needed that.  That his love could change the lives of these 6 children who were not headed any place good.  The movie and the song Kenny sings (Love Will Turn You Around) just moved me and it still does.  The review written by 10 year old me.  🥰"

This blu ray will be added to my collection!<br /><br />I watched the movie because of Charlie Hunnam. I had no idea this was based on a true story. I would actually like to find the book!<br /><br />I thought the movie was really good and sad. I saw some other reviews mentioning an original movie but I never heard of it which is pretty sad. I will have to watch the older one as well.<br /><br />Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾

"Glad I only rented this & still surprised to see so many 5 star reviews. As others said, it is a good movie but it is NOT a great movie. Voice acting & dialogue was for the most part, pretty cringey, so idk if it just translated poorly, or what, but I had a hard time seeing past that. I’ve never been a fan of scenes that just draaaaw out way too long. Like there’s one of our girl running & loudly panting for a very…very long time. This is my first movie by this director tho, so I’m assuming these quirks are just their style. I didn’t find myself really loving any of the characters either, & the plot didn’t seem fully developed in spots. Visually tho, this movie is stunning & it did make me tear up a couple times. The animations are all very lovely. Nothing about the music stuck out to me.🤷🏻‍♀️<br /><br />I would not recommend this for small kids, as there are a few swear words & some references to guys jerking themselves off, so, just keep that in mind."

"If you're having trouble, go into the settings of your region free blu ray player and turn the audio to English dts 5.1, and then turn off German subtitles too. It will play perfectly in English without German subtitles. 👌"

Absolutely love this movie. On point and accurate horse wise. And Quarter Horse people have some beautiful QHs to look at throughout. Had to repurchase it as my original copy no longer plays after chapter 13 😭<br /><br />The movie is like a cliff notes version of the novel. I prefer the novel over the movie but for horse movies this one is one of the better ones out there.

"Ignore all the negative comments!!!!! Love this show!!!!! It’s a different spin on Jane Austen, but since she only wrote 11 chapters, we don’t know where she would have taken the story. Andrew Davies gives us a refreshing  story filled with drama, longingly stares and incredibly delicious chemistry and tension between the two lead characters. The scenery and costumes are top notch as well. As for the explicit details that occur, they occurred in real life. Just because racism and sexuality isn’t usually talked about in period dramas, doesn’t mean it didn’t happen or didn’t have an impact. I’ve read comments about how such things shouldn’t be discussed in a period drama because it’s seems out of place, which is completely ridiculous in my opinion. That being said, the adult content in this show is minimal and historically factual (yes men did swim in the nude at the beach). Props to the cast and crew for doing the research which many who criticized this show didn’t 😉 If you enjoy a love story, watch this show. The only thing missing is a second season, but that can still happen depending on US viewership, so let’s stream away 😊 #sanditonseason2"

Bought this in February but just got around to try to watch in June (past Amazon’s return window 😢 This will NOT PLAY unless you have a special Blu ray player -It is a foreign disk and Is not compliant with normal US standards - this is a Region 2 (or Region B) disk and in the US 99% of Blu-ray players only play Region 1 (or A) The disk is now worthless to me 😡😡‼️

I have to say I'm very disappointed because the blu ray will not play on my blu ray player or my PS4. Apparently the blu ray is not able to play in my region!? So it's basically useless 😕

The disk won't play because they sent me a disk that WILL NOT PLAY in the USA!😡 I can return it but the shipping cost will be the cost of the movie. Not worth my time and money just will not buy from this company again!

"All I can say is this.. the stars in this movie must have truly truly been broke ..and, needed some<br />Money. BADLY... because this was the worst movie,.that I have ever ever Viewed... and now with this covid-19 it's truly going to be hard for actors.. to make movies..<br />Because if they have to wear a mask like everyone on the set would have to do I would suspect their mask would be covered in blue screen so that you cannot see the mask.. but if you are going to risk your life in the entertainment business to make a movie ..I would truly hope that you would find a script and director, that would truly wake it worth it..and NOT A STUPID MOVIE LIKE THIS ONE.. this is the first time that I have purchased a movie and only watched 10 minutes of it it turned it off.. and put another movie here in my Blu-ray player to watch.. and then come back to this movie a few days later and say well what the heck let me see what else goes on in this movie.. and I was so disappointed I didn't know what to do.. it was just horrible.. I truly did not think there was a movie that could go past ..<br />being stupid..but this movie does..<br />As a matter of fact when you look up the word  STUPID..in the dictionary.. they should definitely have a copy of the slip cover of this movie put in the definition..<br />So , I hope you do not waste your money on this movie because Christopher Walken as well as the other stars could not save this movie..👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"

"I am so disappointed to get this cheap copy, badly copied being the movie’s  color is totally inferior. I couldn’t use any other button other than the  play button.  I ordered the 40th Anniversary Fiddler on the Roof which was supposed to come with the Musical’s CD which was not in the case.  I was so disappointed.  I requested my money back and being they make it so hard for you to send it back,  I just kept it considering  it a lost and kept.<br />Next time I’ll paid more for a HD original and get my money’s worth. Feeling Duped 😦"

"I have delighted in this film since I was three years old. From the scene where she takes in the children, to the underwater dancing, to the medieval battlefields of World War Two😉, this film never disappoints. The DVD is better because it has more footage though I was sorely disappointed to find that the footage of “a step in the right direction” had been lost.  I was also delighted to hear that my personal unproven theory that “the beautiful Briney” was originally written for MARY Poppins was true.  The Underwater scene from the Mary Poppins books was a dead giveaway.  I highly recommend this film and the far different but also delightful book to anyone and all."

The acting, cinematography, scenes, directing, story, all Superb!<br />The Special Effects are Phenomenal and Breathtaking, it's  an exciting, endearing  and at times emotionally heartbreaking. It is truly a historically memorable movie that will long live in the hearts of the Jurassic  die hard Fans. It doesn't  disappoint, the excitement continues all throughout the movie  and there is a depth of a moral story as well, of human greed and lust for one's  own self indulgence and inconsiderate narcissism. We can all learn from the movie if we open our minds and our hearts💜"

"This a fantastic anime movie. To get to the point straight and simple, consider this when whatching this movie. Take myspace, twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Combined them all in one, and you have a super social network. Now imagine it whent rouge. That's what this movie is about. How social networks make an impact to our daily life. Their is a good slice of lifein it, awesome animation and outstanding soundtrack. It has good extras and comes in a great package. Their no nudity, so is ok for teenagers, but their is mild to a little moderate in violance. Just a few small scenes with good violence, but that's it. Lol hope this helps to many who wants to see this movie, it's very good. It's a bonus as it's a DVD + Blu-Ray all in one for a good price. Couldn't as for more. For regular DVD, their is 2 discks, 1 the movie, the other with more extras. Mostly interviews. Blu-Ray has all in 1. Enjoy👍"
"This a fantastic anime movie. To get to the point straight and simple, consider this when whatching this movie. Take myspace, twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Combined them all in one, and you have a super social network. Now imagine it whent rouge. That's what this movie is about. How social networks make an impact to our daily life.

"I love this movie, I think it's fantastic and worth a watch. The animation is great, the dub is not bad, plot is easy to follow and has a great message about family. Why the 1 Star??? Package was damaged. The Extras Disc is scratched up, the main Blu ray disc has a scratch  on it and the disc circle holder thingy is broken on both sides so the disc's were floating about in the case getting scratched.<br />I don't care about extras and so far the movie is playing fine but this is upsetting. I wish theirs a partial refund button because I bought it brand new but due to my package probably being thrown around, Amazon made it a used copy. Thanks delivery driver/whomever threw it around👍 5 Stars for you."

"Every concept in this movie was so mind blowing because they deeply resonated with how I've felt about dreams.<br /><br />Probably the most mind-blowing part: In a dream, you never really know how you got to the place where you are, do you? 🤯"

I ordered this to have on hand for my granddaughter. School started and we are having our first visit with her here at the house finally. We put the movie in and it doesn’t work but it’s too late to return it. It’s been sitting in a cupboard since we bought it. 😤😩

If you are an old classic movie buff/watcher this is a MUST HAVE to add to your collection. Very funny comedy even though it is a dark subject matter. Carry Grant is superb in his acting as he always was -definite non stop laughs . Enjoy! It is 100% worth the purchase or as a gift for your fellow classic movie fans. Pop some popcorn 🍿 grab a soda and some candy and have a movie night with family and/or friends. Probably best to watch with children over 10 because while funny it does deal with poisoning unsuspecting guests who do die-darkish old comedy.

"Great movie, just sooo sad at the end. Couldn't stop crying even after the movie ended.😭 It's a movie to make you remember to always accept the little things in life, because you don't always know how it will end up. The movie brings up a peice of our American past that hit my emotions even harder. Great movie, so real. Love life❤"

"Untamed Heart in 93' had me walking out of the movies still sobbing, and walking around town embarrassed that I couldn't stop. It obviously triggered something in me. I don't think I've ever loved a movie character as much as Caroline.<br />The love they shared was very relatable and real for me, resembling a relationship from my past. Movies grab your mind and your soul, not your heart... That's just a saying people made up. 😊 Top film of all time for me."

Would love to see this series in its entirety. Caught a few episodes on Netflix years ago and found it riveting.  The 2 star rating is the fact our set was defective and would either freeze or not load. Customer service was fantastic and sent a replacement only to be the same. So we never could watch it 😞

"In a shockingly wonderful evening in Awestun, TX recently, the wunderkind wizard woman creator/director of SUBURBIA and the DECLINE series appeared before our very eyes and presented these classic documentaries to our lucky small audience in person. Nevermind her exceptional eye-popping Hollywood resume', this lady has SUFFERED FOR HER ART/HEART and continues to bear 🐻 the ache of the of homeless, the suffering and the creative/artistic destitute. Her lifeworks and deepest causes are represented here in these archives and the result is riveting and unforgettable. She descales our eyes and takes us through the swankiest rock n rol/punk slug trails over broken glass and gold dust where few have trod sober and sentient. It was an extreme privilege to meet her and hold her fin-like magical hand. There was a shimmering sheen on us for days afterwards and we felt hipper and cooler for ingesting her images and content in spite of our musty ol' selves. Behold friends..a cultural icon, iconoclast and champion 🏆 of our times.<br />A note 2 U PS...&#34;Come back, come here, come back here...whoooaaahhhhh!&#34;❤✨🌹<br />XxX HOLLYO"

"The year is 1956 and I am but a mere 8 years old watching  and being blown away what is to become my most favorite SCI FI film of all time, enjoying it on my HUGH 12"" Zenith TV. I Never even imagined that some 60 plus years later, I would still be blown away watching it on Blu Ray on my 70"" Toshiba HD TV!! Anne Francis never looked  better in her mini skirts and her beautiful innocence ❤!  More than sexy Anne Francis this wonderful film boasts a great cast , such as Leslie Nielsen in a SERIOUS role, Walter Pidgeon, Jack Kelly, Warren Stevens, AND...ROBBY THE ROBOT!!<br />The special effects & the awesome sets for their time are just OUT OF THIS WORLD!! The soundtrack which I love really sets the mood for this futuristic fantasy and to be honest, I watch it with all the lights out, cranking up my 8 speaker sound system and yes! I feel like I too am on Altair 4!! Be Amazed with the marvels of the Krell and Robby the Robot's "" unique"" personality!!<br />For a true lover of Science Fiction films especially the classics, Forbidden Planet is NOT to be missed!!!!<br />Happy Viewing!! 😊"

Be Amazed with the marvels of the Krell and Robby the Robot's "" unique"" personality!!<br />For a true lover of Science Fiction films especially the classics, Forbidden Planet is NOT to be missed!!!!<br />Happy Viewing!! 😊"

This movie was much more than I expected to be honest. I assumed it was the typical home invasion movie but it isn't by far. I enjoyed this movie although some of the language was a little excessive but many teenagers do cuss a lot. I knocked off one star for bad mastering in spots with the sound. The talking is whisper quiet and then a phone ringing sounds like a nuclear bomb went off Lol. I'm sure they were aiming to get a scare out the audience. I wish they would make a part 2 with the same cast ......................... that survived 😉 Lol

"A fantastic movie in my opinion.<br />Jeff Bridges plays the role of ""The Dude"" a lovable, alcoholic, stoner, slacker, bowler perfectly. I couldn't imagine anyone else doing it better. John Goodman plays a crazy badass and The Dude's friend. Steve Buscemi plays another one of The Dude's friends in his typical comedic supporting character role which isn't necessarily a bad thing in this movie. And you even get a Sam Elliott cameo.<br />The story is a little out there and all over the place, but that's what makes it what it is. But typical of the Coen bros.<br />I guess this movie may not be for everyone, but I have yet to meet someone who has seen it and didn't enjoy it. All I know is I don't buy many movies and I bought this one 🤷."

"Great movie! Much better than Turner and Hooch which also came out the same year but was over rated. This one is the better buddy cop dog cop movie. I'm not saying I didn't like Turner & Hooch, I'm saying this one has a lot more balls to it and is often overlooked and underrated. The quality of it on bluray is the best I've seen it since theater, VHS and DVD.  I highly recommend 👍👍"

"Do not under any circumstances buy this if you do not live in the UK, it's not for our region(UNITED STATES) and u can't return it without paying over $100 in shipping fees which is 3x the amount if not more of the Blu Ray, they also will not accept return if you have opened it, there should be a description that it will NOT play in the United States 😡😠😒😡 I tried the UPS store and an Amazon locker, still same rediculous shipping fee, I feel that if they ship to the states they should mention u will NEED a multi territories Blu Ray player at least when shipping to the USA! Very disappointed at the mislead."

"Hands down. The WORST horror movie I've ever seen! An anti-abortion propaganda film with a ludicrous plot. I actually couldn't care less about any of the characters...especially the ""psycho slasher"" of the film. And to think...such great make up and effects (NOT) were wasted! LMAO Seriously folks, stay far away from this film. The only thing that should have been aborted is this crappy movie...<br />Rating: One lonely turd...💩"

"I had such high hopes for this film. I really loved the 2007 Nancy Drew movie starring actress Emma Roberts and had hoped that this one would be the same or better than that one. This movie was just really bad all the way around. I love Nancy Drew books. I can remember reading them as a kid and teen. I saw a lot of myself in her. This movie didn't really have a deep mystery to solve in my opinion and you really didn't see a whole lot of master sleuthing on Nancy's part either. The mystery was very shallow and Nancy's sleuthing abilities were very basic. There just wasn't a whole lot of substance here in any capacity to call this a true Nancy Drew film. I was just really disappointed because the cast is really good. Actress Sophia Lillis is such a delightful young actress. She was excellent in ""IT."" The writers really did her a disservice providing her with a character and storyline that were just very poorly written. There was just no depth to any of it. And to make this a Nancy Drew related film is truly the biggest mistake of them all here. I was so disappointed watching this movie. It makes me sad thinking about it because the potential was there. The set design was really good. The acting was really wonderful too. The writing just needed to be there and it wasn't unfortunately. I also didn't feel like the writers really knew a whole lot about Nancy Drew before they even decided to write this script. They were off the mark on so many things. Maybe they were trying to create a different version of her or something to bring her up to modern times. I just don't know what they were thinking here. I hope this doesn't end up being a series of movies, but I feel like that's where they are going with this whole concept. This is not a good start. The 2007 Nancy Drew movie was an excellent start, but that series of movies fizzled out somewhere along the way. I just don't want young girls thinking the Nancy Drew in this movie is the true version of her because it's just not...at all. I rather young girls just read the books and avoid the movies if all the subsequent Nancy Drew movies are going to be like this one. Or just have them watch the 2007 version over and over again. I would avoid this movie. It's not even that great of a film standing on its own. I'm just going to pretend it never happened. 😆"

I remember when my family and I rented this on VHS as soon as it came out. I liked it a lot that I ended up ordering and giving this with a handful of other movies (On DVD) as a birthday  / Christmas gift for my sister back In 2016. She isn't all that crazy about a lot of romantic comedies but I know that she will really enjoy this one!!!!!!!!😁😁😁😁😁

"Dubbed in English. Had to turn off captions. Not at all what I expected. Expected old motion picture techniques, but was surprised that it was at 2020 standards. I was somewhat confused with comments about slowmo of the tank's projectile. Huh? But it became an important part of the movie as if it was almost one of the characters.  The drama is great 👍.  You get pulled in to the movie. You feel the character's bonds. There's even the quintessential ""bad guy"". It is the movie that Brad Pitt wished he made, no kidding.  I thank the reviewers who spurred me on to buy this movie. I totally enjoyed it and I will watch it again! Buy it. Buy it now!"

"The first 28 minutes and 15 seconds is basically a modern episode of Bruce Timm's classic Batman: The Animated Series. Unless you are a huge fan of Batgirl I highly recommend just skipping it. Not that I have anything against her, I've actually been a fan since a kid after seeing her in the 1966 Batman TV series, it just does nothing to quantify the actual Killing Joke storyline except for fleshing out her character a bit. Watch this first part like an extra or bonus episode. You might just thank me for it 😉<br />The actual Killing Joke feature itself, which is about 48 minutes long, is just excellent. With the exception of some creative liberties towards the conclusion regarding Joker's &#34;henchmen,&#34; most notably a decisive battle with a certain infamous trio, this feature is very true to the graphic novel. In addition there are several Easter eggs that even the hardcore Batman fan might miss without looking them up on the Internet; I got lucky when I suddenly paused one frame also at the end. What has to be the biggest draw to this feature simply has to be Mark Hamill. He does his best voice acting, I would argue maybe his best acting period, in this run as Joker. If you have ever owned any of the Batman movies, seen the recent or older animated features then you owe it to yourself to at least see this if not add it to your collection. Hope I proved my point. &#34;Here's to crime.&#34;"

"This is a product review only the movie was good but I’m basically review the product only for Amazon customers.! We have too many amateur critics believe this is their own personal movie 🎥 critics lounge 🍿 it’s not . This reviews for the Shout! Factory collectors edition Blu-ray of Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The next Generation....Very good HD Video/Audio transfer..!  I highly recommend any Texas chainsaw massacre fan to buy this movie for one it’s hard to find and for two it’s a collectors edition Blu-ray from Shout! Factory enough said, but I will  continue. It has a decent amount of special features (including two versions of the film theatrical version and a director’s cut version) check my pictures for those thank you sincerely JTriplett"

It is what it is. It's cheaply made with really bad effects. But charming at the same time. Destined to become a cult classic like Evil Dead 😆 Benny is like a mix between Elmo and Baby Sinclair from Dinosaurs. Pretty funny

I really wanted to like this but it's simply a cash grab for Pixar. I felt like I was simply watching finding Nemo with a few differences and less  memorable characters. Even the new characters did the same things as the old ones did in finding Nemo. 😡  It's also really lacking in humor unlike the first one. I own this but I doubt my nephew's or I will watch it again. (They didn't even sir through it the first time)

"It’s very bare bones packaging, if you are a fan of “I Love Lucy” and want the entire collection at a great price then this is for you. I was hesitant because of previous reviews where they said the  case was cracked either on the outside or on the inside spools that hold the discs. Thank goodness mine came in tact & a bonus it arrived on Lucille Ball’s birthday Aug 6th, so ironic. One of my top five favorite episodes is the “Mr. and Mrs. TV Show”, it never seems to repeat on tv. That’s the one where they do the Phipps Department Store commercial and Lucy comes out in that crazy outfit.🤣"

"Looking at the pictures people have taken of their I Love Lucy cases I see a lot of broken ones. Unfortunately for me I too received a broken case. For some reason someone at Amazon decided it was a good idea to ship this in a manila type envelope. Not even an envelope with bubble padding on the inside! This is a Christmas gift for my mom but the broken case isn't a total deal breaker. I'm probably just going to put all of her I Love Lucy DVDs in a carrying case with sleeves anyways because I feel that she will struggle to get them out of the original case and she's not going to display the case or anything. I am however ordering this complete series for myself and I would love to keep the case, so I am really hoping they decide to box it this time and maybe add some bubble wrap. 🤞"

"After seeing jim cummings performance in wolf of snow hollow i looked ip more. I watched this movie tonight. I get it if you don't get it . For me, i wanted to stop watching after about 40 minutes but only because i needed to recenter. It put me in tears. It has some comical elements but it is far from a comedy. It is a hard watch for someone who can relate. What is a film if you dont feel? The essence of film and music is to feel. Not all music and nor all film are meant for everyone. 5 🌟 stars"

"Brand new works fine and the animation is gorgeous HOWEVER, this isn’t the movie i grew up with. These choices are terrible, no wonder it was 16.99 vs the other one. They cut and replaced dialogue/music from the original us release and it’s suuuper obvious.... redubbed kikis lines, and since phil hartman is dead they can’t redub him so they just cut out some of the riffing they didn’t like.... 😢"

"This was a western that was way different at the end, lol. I liked it. I really enjoyed the build up of each character so to speak. You got to meet and learn about each one as the story went on. Would have been better if a better back story was developed on Mrs. O'dery. Was she the Dr.? A Dr was mentioned but only by a reference made of him ""in a bottle."" And the Indians......that just turns the whole movie upside down. The boar tusks? The neck whistle thing?? And the pregnant one with stakes in her eyes?????? Overall an interesting movie that is well worth watching but will leave you wondering why at the end. 👍"

And the Indians......that just turns the whole movie upside down. The boar tusks? The neck whistle thing?? And the pregnant one with stakes in her eyes?????? Overall an interesting movie that is well worth watching but will leave you wondering why at the end. 👍"
THE BLOODY THING IS IN SPANISH!! I'm so mad I could spit nickels😡🤬<br />I saw the original and it was awesome. I'm sending THIS piece of trash back tomorrow get a refund and then an ENGLISH language copy!!!

"Don't order this if you want to use the digital copy because the code has expired😒. You will, however still receive 150 Disney Movie Rewards points. I am disappointed because I would have just bought it on iTunes if I could only have either digital or hard copy."

"There are no jump scares in the movie. It does provide an interesting twist to this genre of movie. By the end of the 🎥 it all makes sense. And, it’s all worth the journey. A young lady wanting to get away from a bad relationship takes on the job of house sitting and taking care of a child. Nuff said. Enjoy. Besides. It beautiful Lauren Cohan from the Walking Dead."

"Unfortunately I didn’t open this till now to watch it. Put the movie in, all the commercials worked fine, but when the movie came on the sound did not work correctly you could here the music but not the people talking. And now obviously it’s too late for a return. Lesson learned watch immediately to be sure.  But I know the movie itself is great because that is why I bought it 🙂"

I have tried to add two photos but am unable. The disk was rattling around in the case as I was opening the package. It is very scratched and marred. I am now playing it to ensure it will play properly.  Not happy! 😡

"I remember watching this movie with my mom back in the 90s and finding it hilarious, so I wanted to re-watch this.<br /><br />I will say that after all of these years this movie is still hilarious, especially with the great assemble cast. Bull Murray is still his funny self in here, Randy Quaid is hilarious with his whining and freaking out, Tony Shalhoub is hilarious in here as well, especially with him acting the role of a man who is an immigrant who speaks no English. Even in those scenes you knew exactly what he was saying 😂.<br /><br />Overall this is such a corny and silly movie, but I was laughing my butt off the whole way through."

"Just when you thought &quot;Purple Rain&quot; couldn't sound any better...after over 30 years of listening to it, this remaster is seriously a revelation!<br />Prince remastered this personally at Paisley Park in 2015 prior to leaving this world way too soon in 2016.<br />The subtleties, the clarity and the seperation in this master of &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, really bring out things that I like may be others thought that were buried in the mix. For example the guitar on &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;! Wow!<br />I don't want to spoil everything for you avid Prince fans like my self, but want to just say BUY THIS!<br />The vault tracks and extended mixes are absolutely amazing also, as is the dvd.<br />So much love has been put into this by Prince, in what was definitely one of the greatest moments in music and his prolific career.<br />Put on some headphones and go back to 1984 and re live &quot;Purple Rain&quot; like you never have before. From one Prince fan to another, this really does hit hard of just how much was in his music, how much he gave the world, and just how much we all miss him!<br /><br />&quot;I never meant to cause you any sorrow, I never meant to cause you any pain&quot;. 💜"

"My favorite movie of ALL TIME!!!! I feel in love when it first came out (I was 6) and I watched it atleast once a week for like two years! I know the songs by heart and thought myself the dances lol! I will say I was very disappointed with the Broadway play! Removing and changing characters, cutting scenes, and the complete butchary of the songs🤬 changing words to the songs, REMOVING SONGS, And replacing them with terrible additions!🤯 I may have already been a little bit due to the absence of Christian Bale, Mush, and Spot Conlon (for whome I still drool a little when I watch now and we're my first loves, but the Broadway show was just not my cup of tea and whiskey. I will continue to love and watch this movie till I die!!"

Best kept secret in my opinion. Not many people seem to have ever heard of the movie. One of my all time favorites and the fact Jonny is in it only adds to it lol 😝 I know I have watched the movie way to many times when I can go around reciting  scenes from the movie. Lol  I bought this copy for my soon to be sister-in-law for Christmas she loved it.

I hate reviewing movies...I'm no critic or even film student. If you want to know how a movie  is I suggest imdb or rotten tomatoes 🍅. So when I review these I'm reviewing the quality of the picture and sound.<br />I have a Samsung QN65QN90A TV and a Vizio soundbar/subwoofer/rear speakers. I typically use my Xbox X to play 4k blurays as opposed to my Samsung M8500 4k bluray player because sorry samsung but the Xbox beats you here 😀.<br />The picture is fantastic and the sound is equally as impressive. Provides a great theater experience just wish it provided a great theater movie as well.

I returned the DVD to day and that cost me $8.00, the DVD was only $12 dollars. Amazon first stated I didn't need to return it, but their Vendor, after 2 weeks thought otherwise... 🤷"

Basically Hollywood lightly roasting itself. Despite the surrealism there is so much relatability to guys like Hobie Doyle and believability of the characters is through the roof. Also George Clooney pretty much plays himself and gets smacked around for commie leanings. Can't go wrong with that. 😂

"4K UHD picture Quality is Beautiful!<br />When I put in the Disc, the Sound Quality was Terrible, then I noticed the default setting is set on Mono. Selected the Surround Option and WOW!!!  Blue Moon Song kicks in! 🤗<br /><br />This Movie has So Much Charm and every moment is filled with Witty Dialogue.<br /><br />If you have Never seen this Film, this 4K UHD is the way to Go."

"Brought it just so I could see the scenes with ""As If!"", when Cher sideswipes two or three cars during her driver's test (""My bad""😂) and when she runs through a stop sign (Dionne: ""Hello, that was a STOP sign.""  Cher: ""I totally paused!😀"") Don't know why they crack me up so but they are my favorite scenes in the movie)"

Great Movie 🎥 Written by Steve Martin. There are some Very Funny Part's. It deals with age and relationship's. It's worth a Look 🙂!

"Good movie,  just neeed more development of the main character.  Also, Kelly commander in the book was a guy, not a female,but nice twist but unnecessary 🙄.  Love Michael B. Jordan as a actor,  just want to see him in something more than a action flick."

Movie Decent Entertainment value but another sub standard BD disc in regards to the quality of the picture’s sharpness ~ a high end blu ray TM disc averages 36 MegaBitsPer Second this P***  P*** disc clocks in at an Avg. of 21 MBPS ! Buy a lemonade get lemons 🍋

"Fake Blu-ray & dvd combo, only 2.0 sound, no subtitles, runs instantly into the movie once disc is inserted….<br />At the very bottom of the case printed in blue dots it reads (made in Mexico)<br />I love how Amazon allows anything and everything to be sold here without checking 🤣<br />I guess this all pays for Jeff Bezos “rocketdick”<br />Sorry rocketship 😝"

"I know a lot if people have a problem with this movie which I understand and agree with to some degree. But, if you look at it as an early animation gem  then the controversy, for me, drops away. In 2006 a movie called The Adventures of Beer Rabbit came out and there wasn't s huge outcry about it. I've watched both and the Brer Rabbit movie isn't that much different than Song of The South. Yes, I am of a paler persuasion but don't believe one race is any better than another. Wasn't happy with the quality of the repro but the company responded to my concerns which was unexpected😀!"

"Released in 1989 Baron Munchausen possesses just enough visual and story telling imagination to compensate for the 127 minutes length of the movie.  The Baron’s story telling stands at the center of this/his tall tale fable which is one part, sometimes bizarre (headless woman deity(?) leaves her Robin Williams Moon god husband during sex (…?) and other parts just clever enough special effects revolving around a cute 7 year old girl whose innocence helps keep the story—and the Baron—from going off the crazy train rails.  Sarah Polley is good and very likable as the girl who basically is the ‘straight man’ to the eventual zaniness.  Too bad the belly of the sea monster scene wasn’t longer than say, well, Robin Williams ad libbing constantly in a jealous rage over the absence of his wife’s head during sex.  Ok it is basically impossible not to laugh at some point.<br />Oliver Reed has arguably a better cameo as the jealous (imagine that) husband of Venus (Uma Thurman) who literally dances on air with the womanizing Baron (it’s his story😅… and a surprisingly good scene).<br />This being a Terry Gilliam directed vehicle it is not surprising someone from Monty Python has a good part, here supplied by Eric Idle as  the fastest man on earth which offers some fun fantasy, running very fast special effects that are comically cartoonish.<br />The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is the type of originality fantasy, odd comedy that should be easier to watch and follow the second time and probably just as humorous.<br />Better to experience with a buzz-on too?<br />The Baron’s story is a PG 13 rating probably too intense and strange for someone the same age as the second main character.  This reminds me of Gilliam’s Time Bandits—with a main character In elementary school—which also was probably inappropriate for a 4th grader.<br />Anyways, this so-called adult enjoyed Baron Munchausen’s Adventures.<br />4.4 stars"

"Omg this is a split image of the show. The names are on point and the director, producers, and actors clearly watch the show and are perfect. I couldn’t ask for a better movie version of an anime. Blows every other action movie out of the water! Goku and master Roshi are amazing and just like the show! If you like dragon ball then you’ll love this!!!!!! Why didn’t they make a sequel????!!!!! The best 2 hours you will ever spend in your life 👍🏼"

I am thoroughly angry 😠 😠 and disappointed. I was so excited to be able to finally watch my DVD's only to open the bag to find a shattered DVD package. Black pieces of plastic fell out onto my lap. I could have cried I am so upset. The DVD's are scratched and I am scared 😨 😨 to even try to put them in my player. I don't understand how they could put so little care and thought into the shipping of fragile merchandise. I've received other DVD 's from Amazon also in the paper envelopes with the clips that hold the DVD's in place broken but never this bad. Something has got to be done to insure that expensive products get to buyers the way they are supposed too.

"First let me preface this by stating that I am a huge Kevin Smith fan and I’ve been waiting for this movie since clerks 2 was released.<br /><br />If you are a Smith fan you will enjoy the movie and it clears shows that he made this movie for his die hard fans, so if you didn’t find clerks or clerks 2 entertaining don’t waste your time this movie isn’t for you.<br /><br />This was a much deeper movie then I could have ever imagined would come from Smith. Plenty of stupid 🍆 jokes and aside from Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adam’s most of his previous cast mates make an appearance including some old friends from the original clerks.<br /><br />Definitely not his best work but damn does it pull on the heart strings and multiple points and I don’t think anyone in the theater left without shedding a few tears."

"I knew that I wanted to see this from the very first moment that I saw the trailer. It reminded me a lot of another movie that I love titled ""Frequency"" with Dennis Quaid. I absolutely love movies like this. I finally watched it last night and I loved it. It is so so good. The 2019 movie stars actors David Oyelowo and Storm Reid. The story, the characters, the acting, everything. It is really well done. I really felt for the characters too. My heart was in tatters the whole time. There were a few minor blips in the storyline that I am still a bit confused about, but other than that, this movie was flawless. It was a gripping thrill ride from beginning to end. I was on the edge of my seat with suspense the whole entire time. This is yet another wonderful film from Blumhouse Productions. I am really loving all of the amazing films that they are putting out there. I don't want to give too much away in regards to the plot, but it is basically about a cop who finds his niece murdered. He is very close to her and it destroys him. He wishes that he could go back in time and save her somehow. Days after the incident, he gets a call from his niece. In her time, it is a few days before her murder. So the uncle tries to put the pieces together with her help to prevent the murder from even happening. It is very much like ""Frequency"" in that regard with the whole time travel/science fiction murder mystery idea. If you enjoy movies along those lines, you will absolutely love this film. I have no idea why this movie wasn't promoted more. I remember that it came out to theatres for a short time and then it just disappeared off the radar. It has suffered a sad fate. I highly recommend this movie. It is a very enjoyable film. 💜"

I like the theme of the movie. The family cared about the safety & concerned about the other family member. Very nice.🙂

"I had to pause it 3 times. Every time I paused it, it would go into a Universal screensaver and I would be stuck there. The only way out of the screensaver was to restart the player. 😒"

I had ordered this a day or two before the release of the new movie no way home. I ordered this as a gift and I love the fact that it had all three of the Spider-Man movies with Tom Holland together. FYI when I searched other online stores to purchase this and even checking what was in stock at my local stores I could not find all three movies together anywhere else but on Amazon. The movie shipped almost immediately when it was released and was delivered way earlier than I expected. I bought this as a gift for a family member and she absolutely loves all these Spider-Man movies and was over the moon that it had the newest movie 🍿 😊

"Finally what I've always been waiting for but never knew it... I remember my parents taking me to see the 1st and 2nd spideman movies when I was a kid then the 3rd as a teen... then later my sister introduced me to the amazing spider man... then I was hesitant to watch the Tom Holland series because I thought I'd be just another do over... again but it was different just enough to be a new and exciting experience and the acting superb, sadly I only gave it a chance thanks to the avengers/Tony Stark and boy am I happy that I did spiderman is not just an unfinished peice of art but one that is whole... If you watch the TH Trilogy you'll understand I highly highly recommend 👌"

No dislikes on this or most animated movies. Ever since I was a child I loved cartoons and in these day's with Pixar and others I just get as happy as I did every Saturday when Bugs & Friends would adorn the TV screen. I am now 61 and still 💛 watching animated movies.

"Shipping was good. The dvd wasn't in the shape as described. Very dirty and scratched, hope it plays! Sorry for the review.😕"
Very funny movie. James Marsden and Russell Brandt are hilarious. My grandkids are getting it for Easter 🐇🐣
"This film isn't for everyone.  To be honest and fair to this film, i purchased it due to its high reviews but did not watch it all the way through.  I had to remove the disc when the fetus scene came on towards the beginning of this film.  Symbolic or not, there are other symbols less graphic that could have expressed the same feeling (he felt) if indeed that was its intent!  But then that's just my opinion.🤔"

"I suppose I should have looked into it more, but after watching a different tragic film the night before, was in the mood for a romantic comedy.  I read just a bit of the blurb on Prime and saw it listed as such here and thought ""well THAT'S an interesting backdrop for a rom-com, what the hell - I'm in!""<br /><br />. . . Have been unable sleep since watching last night.<br /><br />That is not to say the movie is bad, though.  Its just, some scenes are pretty repulsive.  The worst is left to the imagination but. . . Still real bad.  As a meseed-up-already GWOT vet with a thing for Asian girls, I can't say I wasn't extremely triggered by this one!<br /><br />I feel like it was a very important and poignant watch though. . .<br /><br />. . . Just could have done without THAT ONE scene, honestly. . . 🤮"

Who said that 🎄 movies always had to be jolly and fun for this movie they did make it fun but when you have put a lot of thought into the storyline you are in for a great holiday horror experience<br /><br />The plot of this story is that Ashley is supposed to be moving away to Goto college etc to start a new leaving behind her past boyfriends and her job as a 👶 sitter.  Luke played by the brilliant Levi Miller decide to make a final move on his babysitter or a least make it to second based.  Things to get very weird when someone breaks into Luke home and this is where the plot twist begin remember everything is not what it seems.<br /><br />This films is living proof that you can make a smart horror film and still have the great entertainment factor.  I am sorry I couldn't tell you more because it would ruin the plot of the story so let just say that this is no home alone and it's a cross between scream and bits of pieces of home alone.  This is very smart in making the audience get into the plot especially when you have a great performance by Levi Miller who is so funny and amazing to watch that this film goes into my horror classics of all time.  I love krampus and slient night deadly night  but this tops them all because you never know what is going to happen next who is playing who or more importantly  will the person get away with it.  These are questions you will see in the movie and ask yourself I will never look at baby sitting and Christmas again.<br /><br />A super plus for a brilliant film I am waiting for part 2.

I just ran across this and I enjoyed it. Even though it was a low budget film I would give it a thumbs 👍.<br />I especially liked the ending.

"Okay. I saw that one reviewer brought up the point I was going to make. Where the hell did these creatures come from? They can't pilot an intersteller vehicle because they're blind. Did they enter the Earth through a worm hole? A rip in the fabric of time and space? A portal from another dimension? I'd sure as hell would like to know! Other than a few plot holes, an alien with lots of head flaps(?), and a rather crappy ending, the movie was excitingly fresh! I worried because of all the hype. Thought this may be another ""It Follows"", in my opinion quite possibly the worst horror movie ever conceived, but this isn't even a horror movie! It's essentially a science fiction yarn with a horror twist. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski were terrific in their roles as the parents of 3 kids. The alien designs were frightening enough,  until those damn head flaps hadda open! LOL I won't say much else except that if you can overlook the minute defective details, ""A Quiet Place"" is one hellova roller coaster ride worth checking out! Recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👽"

"😱This has always been my favorite JOHNNY DEPP movie. It's a 1999 movie so by now most everyone should have seen it.  A very cool halloween movie, or a creepy ,almost scary with Johnny Depp and a few humorous scenes you 'll always remember kind of movie .The acting is good , the clothing is great for the time period. The special effects really make this one a must seeand a must have. THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😱"

"This movie was somewhat of a mess. It was kind of hard to follow. That being said the saving grace of this movie was the superb acting of the main cast. John David Washington was very convincing, excellent. I have never seen him before but Wow, could he act. Robert Pattinson was outstanding in his role as Neil. Throw in a classic actor like Kenneth Branagh and you have a great cast. Sadly the plot don’t really live up to all the hype. Maybe I just didn’t understand it. I don’t know. Three Stars for the outstanding casting.<br />🌟🌟🌟"

Beware of getting the blue ray! The reason it is less money is cause it is the old version of war and peace with Audrey Hepburn. I did not want this one and I am not pleased. I just finished the book and was really excited to show my wife the mini series cause I have read great reviews. I'll just have to wait a few more days. 😕

"This is my favorite movie of all time. I saw it on the big screen in college and have it on VHS, but no longer have a working VHS player. Occasionally I’d search for it to see if it’s anywhere, and a while ago  Amazon had it on Blu-ray, which I’d never seen before. It said that it only worked on the UK type of player, but several comments said it worked in the US too, so I decided to give it a try. IT WORKS! I can’t even begin to express how happy that makes me. Much better quality than VHS, too. Shipping did take longer than expected, but we’re in the middle of a pandemic, so it’s ok. I’m so happy to have found this and my Alan Rickman collection is almost complete. 🙏❤️"

It was specified this dvd would only play on a Region B compatible player. I assumed one of my DVD players were compatible or could be technically modified. I was wrong so far and stuck with a dvd that I can’t play. Help😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

This movie  was unbelievable I truly believe this is the best one I have ever done from both sides on Godzilla‘s peace and for King Kong I haven’t seen The original version of Kong’s movie in quite some time but I am definitely now going to get it for Christmas this current year and watch it  pretty soon coming up and  I got this movie for my birthday and it was awesome it was beyond amazing and so adventurous to watch on desk especially in the 4K quality !. The action scenes Were downright addicting and completely flawless . When First I knew about this movie releasing I miss my opportunity to watch it on HBO Max so I waited patiently until my birthday which was in August to get it on disk and get it in the 4K version when I watched it I was so happy to see it and I do not regret one single bit of it !!👍👍🙌🏾🤭😅😭👏😩😀🤩

"Great American story , Black American musical artiste meets low down Italian American street guy, who also works with his hands ....but in a less “artistic “ way.<br />They travel together in the time just before civil rights legislation succeeded . Ali is there at the precipice , in fact developed a friendship w rfk (a bond which becomes a life-line, of sorts . See the movie!).<br />Mortensen is straight out of the Sopranos casting net, somewhat one dimensional here , not allowed to emote dramatically but still effective in a laid back way.<br />Vallelongo is fine but she looks about 12 years younger than mortensen .<br />Superb screenplay and cinematography .<br />I thought a great opportunity was lost to capitalize on a jail scene : Ali reveals that he is gay - after he tells his protector he was married . A street kinda guy in 1962 would say , “that’s what I don’t get! You said you was married !” They could have left the scene on the cutting room floor, as finely acted as it is.<br />By the way, his “gay” orientation is a rumor , only , so the scene becomes even more inappropriate upon that consideration .<br />Ali going into the belly of the beast is not really explained : I may have missed whether he or record execs made the decision.<br />And why would a distinguished , accomplished musician even *know* about this semi- goodfella? (We DID enter the theatre a little late😀).<br />Very engaging musical soundtrack . We hear Aretha’s first hit single , Little Richard’s “Lucille” (actually a 1970s re-recording ), and many lesser known R and B gems which fell under the couch. Should make a great CD!"

"Well it's funny! from advocates of the movie. I think the funny parts are like gauze to cover the senseless acts of violence, or to make it more acceptable. But the movie did a bang up (get the joke) job at the theaters. So next time it can be even more hate filled, gory action while Deadpool gets all shot up and never dies as if getting shot over and over is a game where no one gets hurt! So you can shoot someone and give a snarky comment about leaving the oven on and this makes everything ok? Great message to be putting out there in the world especially to young adults and teenagers👎"

"Terrific depth and sensitivity to the good and bad differences and potential in all of us.  If continued, this could have been a good series. It's a shame she and her family died. As for the story itself: I think the scriptwriter went a little overboard on the sadism he worked hard to project in the villains, but the world does have a lot of that in reality. I like the way Harmony was shown as a protector. I think the rest of the movies should move forward. What an awesome interesting series it could be, if done correctly. 👍 Carolyn"

"Very disappointed. Damaged DVD. Froze in perfume shop then jumped to stairway to heaven. Could not get picture to properly fit screen, I have options on my screen to remedy this. Also I was disappointed with quirky of Bluray. One of the  special features did not work. (I have the latest flat screen). Gene Kelly career profile was good. The first special feature did not work and I really wanted to see that. Luckily the Ballet worked but did not properly fit screen but was able to enjoy it.<br />Gave away my old copy so now I have nothing😝😡😕"

Probably because I love Renee zellwiger as an actress! My honest opinion the acting was terrible though! And it has funny qualities but overall the movie was great! I love the whole prom thing! Kinda changed it up a bit, being lost in the woods and comes across a farm house and I like the chase scenes and how they made leatherface a drag queen 🤣🤣🤣 sorry for the spoiler"

"Arrived way before I was told it would in perfect condition, and it was beautifully packaged. The only reason I don't give five stars is because since it came from the United kingdom, I have to switch the region on my computer DVD every time I watch it, because I live in the United States. I don't have a TV right now, so I'm sure that will change in future and be easier. 🤗<br /><br />As for the film, it has always been one of my favorite period films. Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are two of my favorite actors, and it is such a pleasure to watch them. The rest of the cast deliver, as well."

"One of our top 10 movie of all time. If you ever had to split the holidays between divorced parents, you may find it funny too. It is spot on portraying a couple to has managed to avoid going home for the holidays for years, and now find themselves back there. There’s dumb humor, but if you are a Vince Vaughn fan, you’ll love it. The parents are perfectly self absorbed in typical fashion. Watched it with our teen children the other day and they didn’t get it. Maybe it’s more suited for those of us damaged by our families 😂."

It is spot on portraying a couple to has managed to avoid going home for the holidays for years, and now find themselves back there. There’s dumb humor, but if you are a Vince Vaughn fan, you’ll love it. The parents are perfectly self absorbed in typical fashion. Watched it with our teen children the other day and they didn’t get it. Maybe it’s more suited for those of us damaged by our families 😂."

"It slapstick, its quirky, its not about to win any major adwards. That being said, this is a gem  that'll have you shaking your head and leaves you with a good, nostalgic feel.<br />This is what life was growing up in suburbs. For those who are critics- this movie 🎥 would be lost on you. Its not made to be taken seriously. Love it for the silliness that it represents"

"Absolutely love this DVD! If you're looking for a stroll down memory lane, this is perfect! I watched this religiously as a kid, and thought it was hysterical. Now that I'm an adult, and can actually understand the jokes, it's even funnier! Good quality, cornball humor, over-the-top attempt at censoring the farging cussing, and Michael Keaton! I'm just so happy to share it with my family! It's truly impossible to find anywhere else. Look up the prison scene/priest scene on YouTube, THAT is what you're in for! 😄"

"The Ipcress File (1964) starring Michael Caine is the best in the 3 movie, Harry Palmer series.  It was followed by Funeral In Berlin (1965) and then Billion Dollar Brain which is the movie in the series that most resembles a James Bond movie.<br />Ipcress File—and Funeral In Berlin—have been described as ‘the thinking man’s Bond.’<br /><br />Interesting to me the classic look of Ipcress File resembles the realistic look of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service the James Bond movie many have reconsidered as one of the better ‘made’ Bond movies.  Peter Hunt is the Editor on The Ipcress File and, eventually, directed On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.<br /><br />I watched the Ipcress File (DVD) with subtitles; and with commentary by Director Sidney J Furie and Editor Peter Hunt—for the second time—picking up some good, behind the scenes tidbits to recommend this 2020 Kino Lorber disc highly:  Sidney Furie admitted he was not liking the script, early on, and inspired by some Johnny Walker(!) 😅in his coffee, insisted to cinematographer Otto Heller that they needed to come up with something different to carry the script which was changing day to day, forcing the movie to be shot in the order it is seen (a movie ‘shot in sequence’ is very rare).<br />Another tidbit:  Joan Collins was the first choice for the important part Sue Lloyd portrayed.  Glad they used Sue Lloyd, actually, and hope to find another movie she was in.  She is quite fetching as the agent working for … hmm.<br /><br />But, again, the extremely original camera angles and obstructed vision shots (spying on someone through the ‘lens’ of a parking meter! for example), to demonstrating Harry Palmer is near sighted, certainly, gives The Ipcress File a much deserved praise for realism, that includes a simple, knock down, not too dragged out fight scene.<br />The tension in the plot builds from the first kidnapped scientist, what the acronym Ipcress stands for, a rather threatening CIA agent who, also, is ‘spying’, and the eventual psychological capacity of the ‘thriller’ conclusion.<br />Also along the way there is a Cold War murder twist — or two, suspicious phone calls, and a ‘brainwashing’ process that is demonstrated in realistic, horrific detail.<br /><br />I first saw The Ipcress File when I was about 12 years old, immediately in awe of the camera work, realizing I would like the movie even more when I was older—when I, actually, really understood it.  Consider the ‘mission’, finally, complete.<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite movies.<br />And I almost forgot to mention the truly brilliant and perfect music score by John Barry.  It is much different than Barry’s more popular James Bond theme.<br />Nigel Green and Guy Doleman are, also, both very good as Palmer’s close to the vest, ‘two’ bosses, Dalby and Ross.<br />I haven’t given many 5 star ratings.  The Ipcress File 5 plus stars.<br />Bonus feature also offers a very ‘likable’ Michael Caine interview.  A definite plus."

"Loved the movie! It's a Star Wars for a modern generation. I enjoyed the fact that it showed the &#34;force&#34; is there for anyone and not just a chosen few. The actors were excellent, it made me laugh and cry. Rian Johnson did great!👍May the force be with us all!!!"

"Samantha Robinson is exquisite, and the film is hilarious. Absolutely worth the money. I adore this film.<br /><br />It’s like a throwback to the past, done in the present. Clever, funny, and hip. If you’re a fan of the genre, you can’t go wrong, plus you get to look at Samantha. That’s 5 stars on its own! 😍"

A must see film but this copy didn’t include an insert and it’s the kind of neo cult classic that requires an insert or additional disc with behind the scenes and director’s voice over edition.  Lighting and chanting in that Criterion comes out with a new DVD/Blu-Ray version ✨🦋🐸🌛✨

"This is probably one of my top 3 movies(check out Jumanji 2017 and Avengers: Infinity Wars as well), and I watch it more than many of my movies. This is the best Thor, and Taika Waititi was destined to make and reboot the Thor franchise. I love how they used Hela as the female villain, and the actors rocked this movie. Watch it and you won’t be sorry.😁😁"

This was a movie I had to have in my collection.  This was a favorite of my father and I recall watching this movie with him and the family (Great memories).  DVD and its content was great.  The movie quality and sounds was also great and I enjoyed reliving that movie moment with my kids now. 🛒😁👍

"This movie is one of my most favorite from when I was a kid.  5 stars for that!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars is because when I received it, the box and sleeve looked like it had been crushed.  Some of the plastic was even broken and rattling around inside the case.  Looked like someone stepped on it.<br /><br />Good news is, the discs were unharmed and scratch free.  Thank goodness I have a spare box, but now the insert doesn't fit.  I know, not that big a deal, but I cherish the crap out of this movie.  😊<br /><br />Summary: Get the movie! It's dated, weird and fantastic!  You'll love it!"

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 for the cheerleader tryouts alone it's worth it
Hated this movie. It was horrible. Sex between a human and a monster. Disgusting. Lots of sexual content that was unnecessary. Probably explains all the awards. Two hours I’ll never get back. Horrible movie. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
"Short Version: Predictable and spoiled by Red Ban Trailer as well as unnecessary Beastiality.<br /><br />Actual Review: I preface this by saying I'm a big Guillermo Del Toro fan since i saw Pan's Labyrynth as a kid. Since then i enjoyed Hellboy 1 and 2 and loved Pacific Rim. When this movies trailer dropped i was curious and excited, it was unique and seemed beautiful. I was looking forward to how this Romance would come to be.<br /><br />  And then the red ban trailer dropped. In hindsight the &#34;Red Ban&#34; could just as easily mean whole movie except for the End, so don't watch that if your considering renting or buying this. But that is not why it's predictable entirely, that falls solely early in the movie. We are introduced to our Main Character a mute who is very lonely, and thirsty. That is her character. You then have her two friends, one is her neighbor a funny and helpful artist on a downpoint in his life. The other is her co worker who looks out for her and helps speak for her at work, Its a shame her accent is so God Damned played up and annoying. Then we come to our Antogonist played by Michael Shannon playing Most of Michael Shannons roles, a mean creep with no redeeming quality. Solely there to root against. Lastly our 🌟 and selling point for this movie, The FishMan! A cool and great looking creature who is tortured most of the film as well as having a childlike sense of wonder since he is learning new things. Keep in mind i compared it as Child Like. Ok spoilers here on out.<br /><br />  I keep ragging on the trailer, introduces characters and synopsis does that right, but also shows scenes consecutively as they happen in the movie. So heres synopsis of trailer and compare it to the movie if you see it.<br />Lonely Mute Lady has a daily/nightly routine as she goes to work. One night a creature is brought in by a creepy Government Man.  Government man is obviously abusing said Creature and comes out with missing Finger. It is revealed that Main Scientist is a Russian Spy, you know because you have to know that going in not like it could be a twist or anything. Then we get a creepy scene of Government man losing finger which would have been better seeing in the movie for the first time. After said incident she begins seeing creature more and more. She gives him hard boiled eggs and introduces music to him. That is in the trailer, you'd think they did more while making a connection in the movie, but nope, they don't, that is it! Scenes of her feeding him eggs and &#34;dancing&#34; with him, THEY'RE IN LOVE NOW! Ignore the fact he is a Fish Man. No scenes of her coming to terms of &#34;hmmmm this kinda like beastiality&#34;. Back to the Trailer they get him out of the facility, because again we have to know this, not like it ruins any tension in the film as they are getting him out. We find out Scientists cover is blown as well as Government Man coming after Fish Man. That is the Movie! Minus the Ending.<br /><br />  Now for the spoiler early on. Our main character just so happens to have scars on her neck. Not much explanation to how she got them except that she's had them since she was young. Now these scars if you look at them are parallel to eachother, and on both sides of her neck. Hmmmmmm I'm no Detective but hmmmm these scars seem to ressemble DARE I SAY GILLS! In a movie about a Fish Man. Now I'm no Screenwriter either all i have is common sense. This movie was gonna end with her living in the ocean as some fish creature, with the Fish Man obviously, why would she go live in the ocean alone. So there you have the story about how a trailer and specifically placed scars ruined this movie for me.<br /><br />  Lastly their relationship. I had no problem with it until it outright turned sexual. Now it was gonna happen at some point in their lives but it couldn't have happened when they lived in the ocean? because at that point she could have been part fish. But no it happened while he is healing in a tub learning even more now since he was out of the facility. She sees him before heading out but changes her mind and powerwalks back in there. He looks worried as to whats going on, she then strips naked and his eyes widen with his childlike wonder like &#34;WHAT'S GOING ON&#34; she then locks the door behind her. It's revealed they had sex, but that scene before she closes the door left an awful taste of &#34;oh God she just forced herself on him&#34;. Not the case tho because we find out he apparantly has a Dick as she explains it to her friend in one of the most cringiest conversations I've ever seen on film. And only her friend spoke laughing it off like &#34;you had sex? But How? You wild&#34; Their love was better innocent and new besides by the end it's implied they are together they could have sex in the future. But gotta have it in your face, was it for humor? I just don't see why it had to be presented like that. It seemed like and older lady coming on to some kid, and yes i know he was old but he was LEARNING ABOUT THE WORLD!<br /><br />  The movie was very aesthetic, but predictable and disturbing. Falls in a long line of gotta keep this person/ creature safe from Government/Bad Guys. Free Willy, Stranger Things, E.T., etc. Mediocre film made more dissapointing for the hype and admiration of the Director. I'd give it 2 1/2 but am unable here. Overhyped and Overated.<br /><br />P.S. theres a ridicoulous dance number that's suppose to be artsy fartsy but came off hilarious and ridicoulous."

"One of my all time favorite movies, so I was excited to watch it.. This DVD had nothing on it other than a trailer for some movie called Crazy Beautiful that just loops over and over again. There’s no title menu, nothing. Just a 1 min 42 sec trailer. 🙄 Came back to the listing on Amazon just to find three other reviews from people who had the same issue."

I love these old classics black & white movies the silver screen stars of the 1940s and 1950s can watch over and over they have that classic film Noir 🎥 picture.

"We love this film, too.  A bit too much for younger teenagers, but wonderful RomCom. And it gives Welshmen the notoriety  they deserve. 🙂  A special, if subtle treat ... walking through the Nottingham Hill high street as the seasons change."

Decent movie.bit of a tear jerker. Amazons rating too high as always ~ this movie got me wondering if Blu-ray TM makes lunar bound modules perhaps that was why Apollo #13 was so messed up! The pic quality of this disc fluctuated wildly 20MBPS-29 very Grainy!😢

I'm finally purchase this blu-ray movie 🎥 &#34;Apollo 13 -20 Anniversary Edition. I'm testing the blu-ray on my blu-ray player and the transferring is great 👍🏾 I'm remember is came in the Theater when I was 14 years old and then it came on video after I turn 15 year old my freshman year in high school so I bought the movie on VHS tape. On my first time seen it great movie 🎥 one of favorite movies with Director Ron Howard. I'm glad 😁 the 20th Anniversary Edition comes on Blu-ray.

"I was so excited for this box set, but when it arrived it had two copies of the same disc and one of the discs missing. I contacted Sony entertainment directly to send a replacement disc and emailed them twice with all the information, but that was the beginning of February and now it's April with no replacement being sent 😕 bummer they don't care about their customers.<br /><br />*UPDATE* I contacted Sony Entertainment asking for them to look into my case and I received a prompt response that there is no updates available to my case. So apparently 2 months isn't enough time to mail a missing disc to a customer. When this same type of thing happened with the Friday the 13th box set, Shout Factory sent me replacement discs within a couple weeks. Too bad Sony isn't as good at conducting a business at they are."

I pre-ordered this special edition set to give as a birthday gift for a friend in the UK. He opened it over the weekend and discovered that there were two discs that were the same which means one is missing. We were both so disappointed. I would’ve returned it but the international shipping cost is nearly the amount I paid 🫤

"A decent Blu-ray for a great cult classic remake of Zaotoichi The Blind Swordsman series of films and various classic japanese cinema... R.I.P. Rutger Hauer for making this such a fun, cult classic action family R RATED film, a rarity. This Blu-ray has a neat retro vhs looking slipcover, the interior art has the theatrical art on it of Hauer.<br /> My family love films like this. It's got Terry Oquinn from Millennium, The Stepfather series, and LOST. It's got bubba from raising arizona... It's got Meg fricking Foster!!!!!! 🖤 Too bad it's just a decent Blu-ray with no extras really at all, no Rutger Hauer, Mill Creek Entertainment really should have released a special edition of this movie YEARS AGO, when Hauer was alive. 😢 Oh well, it's on Blu-ray finally. Thanks, Mill Creek."

"When i purchased this i did it with the intentions of watching the movie 📽️🍿🎬🎞️🎦and reading the English subtitles because in language on the description it says Mandarin. I was surprised that when i put the disc 💿in my player the (set up) had English audio 🎉🎊. This movie brings so many childhood memories to me watching it @ the Times SQ NY cinemas and on the Saturday TV 📺Drive cinema hour! The Blu-ray is super clear and this disc allowed me to put my 25 year old DVD version away because it was so blurry, that i just couldn't enjoy the movie causing me to buy this Blu-ray version and be totally satisfied with it and recommend it to any other Kung fu/SB fan! I would just like to repeat it has English audio and is worth every penny!"

My son has always wanted to watch Deadpool but was too young so this version is just right. He loves it and can’t wait to see the other versions. He’s 9 so it’ll be a few years before that happens 😊

"For the 3rd version of Deadpool 2 this is actually not a bad version. Taming the language and gore down actually gives this movie more focus and enables you to notice the characters developments and stories more. I don’t like how much they changed the beginning, I do like how a lot of the humor is still in tact even without the F bombs 💣 If this is a presentation of what Deadpool May be like in future MCU films, then I can accept it. They kept the X-men cameo and the Brad Pitt cameo in this version. The love story has more focus and a beautiful wall painted image of Stan Lee on the side of a building with RIP was a beautiful touch. The theatrical original version and Super Duper Cut are both superior to this. But Once Upon A Deadpool is worth a watch for all Deadpool fans."

"I LOVED this movie! Some people were complaining that the first part of the movie was slow, but I thought everything about the movie was just right! The storyline telling about what’s going on since the last movie all the way to the end. It was VERY satisfying for me.<br />This is coming from a 57 year old “Nonnie” that happens to love superhero movies! (Possible spoiler alert!) Yes there were some sad parts but nothing or nobody lives forever.<br />Did I mention that I LOVED this movie?!?🙂"

This movie is fogettable and just Meh😠.<br />Honestly i just got if for the collection.
"A breath of fresh air out of the DC Universe. This movie was funny and balanced the dark overtones of the foster care system, being abandoned, and overcoming self-doubt. Zachary Levi did a fantastic job as a superhero 👌🏽 I hope that they continue this trend of individual superhero movies using humor and drama instead of making everything dark, gritty, and untenable."
"Maybe I’m biased because I LOVE ZACHARY LEVI, but it’s seriously such a great story. Best part? Well, aside from some great character arcs, and some really great statements on what it means to be a family and the value of opening yourself up to other people... it has Zachary Levi in it! 😄"

"I received this movie in excellent condition and in the estimated time I was given.  When viewing I rather enjoyed it and have watched it several times in the short period I have owned it.  This movie highlights the issues in the teenage society and struggles throughout life.  It will make you laugh,  feel like crying, piss you off,  and everything in between!  I hands down love it!!  💜❤💖"

"My daughters loved the original release of this, with the darling, sweet little voices. Then I bought them the DVD and they absolutely hated that the voices had been changed to American actors with 'regular' voices. I thought it would be awesome to get them an original version for Christmas. Found a listing and scoured the description to make sure there was NO mention of Dakota Fanning since she is part of the reworked audio.  No mention of her, or any other Western actors, so I assumed (yeah I know...) it was the original version. Used, so I thought that was a positive that it could be older version also. Bought it. SO excited!!! The disc arrived quickly! I popped it into the player..... Nooooooooooo! The voices are the reworked ones😩 What a let-down, and waste of money. I don't blame the seller. There was no indication of the change anywhere on the outside. Not even it the fine print. It's going to Goodwill this afternoon. Make sure you know what you are getting if you buy a copy of this film!!!"

This is a rip off. Definitely NOT 4k. Not even Blue Ray 1080P. Most of the time the picture looks grainy and the Audio Surround Sound NOT impressive at all. What a disappointment.  Bonus is just commentaries. No deleted scenes nor bloopers.👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

He just meets a new ""superhero"" and in hours gives this stranger his idol Tony Starks legacy? Hah!<br />Maybe if he was 12 instead of a sixteen year old Avenger!<br />I'm not buying it...but I'm not a teen anymore either! 😏"

"I watched this movie a lot growing up, and I had to get it for my teen daughter! You can't beat it for $3.99! Amazon is filled with hustlers and scammers these days so I was slightly worried, but pleasantly surprised... There was something a little off about the recording itself, it reminded me of a lifetime movie if that makes sense? But you can deal with that for $4 bucks 😁"

"This is one of me and my mom’s favorite movies. When l was a pre-teen we would watch this movie and just laugh. I forgot all about it just until yesterday when we were talking about Christina Applegate and her battles with Breast Cancer over the years. I have a dvd copy of this classic flick in storage but after our conversation yesterday I decide to purchase this flick through Amazon Instant Video In HD, it was $9.99. So last night I watched it before bed and if just brought back good memories of my childhood and I just laughed and laughed. So the moral of this story is number one DON’T HIRE AN OLD GRANNY BABYSITTER, it’s so 1960s. And also it shows that survival is of the fittest, these kids knew how to survive without their mom around for two months, it is a a Hollywood movie so somethings just would never happen like that in real life. Like dumping the dead babysitter at the mortuary for someone else to take care of 😂. Also just walking into a business or company and submitting a fictitious resume and getting a higher level position over other people. Also when Walter fell off the roof and broke his leg, you know the police would have been called and there would have been a full fledged investigation and their mother would have been called. So l realize they can’t elaborate on everything but this was a comedy so it’s supposed to make you laugh 😂. All in all this is a great early 90s classic cult (few followers) flick. If your like me and have seen the movie a million times and love it or new to it you will laugh and laugh. It’s a must see flick."

"This is classic Roger Corman cinema with Vincent Price doing what he did best!  It's good fun with a camp horror twist.<br /><br />As a Peter Lorre fan, seeing him paired with Price in ""The Raven"" and ""The Comedy of Terrors"" was quite interesting and a special comedic treat. This continues the journey in more tales from Edgar Allen Poe. 😁<br /><br />From IMDB:<br />""Three tales of terror involve a grieving widower and the daughter he abandoned; a drunkard and his wife's black cat; and a hypnotist who prolongs the moment of a man's death.""<br />—J. Spurlin"

"The one thing that made me cringe was no safety vest or face guard or dental protection in earlier bull riders. Not sure how any of them made it out alive. 🤕<br /><br />I was amazed even the naughtier side buckle bunnies were portrayed. Happy to see Lane was a human. He did make mistakes as all the attention and adoration which sometimes brings upon all athletes .  I know his mother has said Lane was a Christian which the movie never acknowledged. His father wasn't as critical as portrayed in the movie either.<br /><br />I think the movie was well made. The rodeo bull riding scenes were awesome. Luke Perry did a wonderful acting job. He is very believable as Lane. That is big shoes to fill indeed.<br /><br />I saw the movie way back  which made me sad for Lane Frost and family. However, I didn't really know who Lane was. I just bought the DVD because I love and respect bull riders now. I understand now why Lane was and continues to be an outstanding bull rider as well as person in bull riding history.<br /><br />I"

Best rodeo movie ever made. Sometimes I just watch the riding scenes as they are first rate. The closing credits still bring a tear to my eye as Lane was such an outstanding rider and person🤠. RIP Luke Perry

The DVD case had some external damage I thought no biggie.  I finally had chance to actually watch the movie today and during some of the movie the picture is clear and most it is very low def.  Some scenes were actually skipped over.  I could try to reverse back and try to play the scenes that skipped but it would just skip again but clearly there were other scenes.  Very disappointed!!  The movie was clearly not original but a bad copy.  I do not recommend buying from this seller.  Going to find it elsewhere.  😤

It's pretty sad he just passed way away this week and you have jacked this movie up to 45 dollars last night it was 30.00 dollars.  That's just crazy and very sad. Have some respect for him and his family 🙁

"Got Haunted Connecticut the other day. What a great film, Tony was awesome and really knew what he was doing. It was great to see Tony in front of the camera this time, he is so on the up and up and doesn't over do it like the other investigation series I watch. It's very refreshing to see someone who really cares about what they are doing. I can't wait to see more of you Tony and what else you have for us paranormal fans. Keep up the great work!! 👍🏻"

It's very refreshing to see someone who really cares about what they are doing. I can't wait to see more of you Tony and what else you have for us paranormal fans. Keep up the great work!! 👍🏻"
Funny as hell. All star cast. I love that Snoop Dogg has a small part in the movie. This movie is awesomely hilarious  👍👍👍

"As of the time of writing this review, you can buy The Village and The Sixth Sense for $5 each. Save the three bucks, buy those, and if you must then wait until Signs is free on one of your streaming platforms.<br /><br />The Village: a masterpiece. Great acting, great everything.<br /><br />The Sixth Sense: brilliant! The fact that they didn’t accidentally give away the twist for anyone watching it the first time it’s a testament to how perfect the acting, filmmaking, scripting, and editing are.<br /><br />Signs: god awful! One of Mel Gibson‘s more mediocre performances, which is surely saying a lot. The twist is that everything happens for a reason 🙄. Literally. The son has asthma because that way the alien can’t suck out his soul, the daughter leaves half-empty glasses around because it turned out aliens are scared of water. If god or whatever made all of that happened just to save literally four people from the aliens, why not just skip the middleman and not send aliens? And, as an alien, why the hell would you come to earth if you’re terrified of water? You landed on a planet covered in water, but can’t be in a room with a couple glasses of water? Please."
"Would be great if there were an option for ZERO stars!<br /><br />Where to begin. Unrealistic, and not remotely based in fact. Matt Damon's character captures an important Saddam loyalist, and states very seriously ""Maybe this guy knows where to find the WMD."" Cartoonish from start to finish.<br /><br />Damon then meets with Iraqi General Ayad al-Rawi (played masterfully by Igal Naor) in order to convince al-Rawi to return with Damon to ""bring the truth that Iraq had no WMD."" Preposterous -- al-Rawi would slit Damon's throat in a second, and the claims of one general must be weighed against the claims of hundreds of other generals, every international intelligence agency, and also the United Nations itself (including Hans Blix).<br /><br />The film plays on the false premise that: 1) the world had to prove Saddam had WMD, and 2) that WMD was the sole reason for war. Both are false. The burden of proof rested with Saddam, who had to prove Iraq destroyed thousands of tons of WMD, but Saddam refused to do so, right to the end (as Chief UN Weapons Inspector Hans Blix stated to the UN Security Council in January 2003)...<br /><br />---<br /><br />""Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance -- not even today -- of the disarmament, which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.""<br /><br />Dr. Hans Blix, Chief UN Weapons Inspector<br />Addressing the UN Security Council<br />January 27, 2003<br /><br />---<br /><br />""I have mentioned the issue of anthrax to the Council on previous occasions and I come back to it as it is an important one. Iraq has declared that it produced about 8,500 litres of this biological warfare agent, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991. Iraq has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction. There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared, and that at least some of this was retained after the declared destruction date. It might still exist. Either it should be found and be destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision or else convincing evidence should be produced to show that it was, indeed, destroyed in 1991.""<br /><br />Dr. Hans Blix, Chief UN Weapons Inspector<br />Addressing the UN Security Council<br />January 27, 2003<br /><br />---<br /><br />""The nerve agent VX is one of the most toxic ever developed. 13,000 chemical bombs were dropped by the Iraqi Air Force between 1983 and 1988, while Iraq has declared that 19,500 bombs were consumed during this period. Thus, there is a discrepancy of 6,500 bombs. The amount of chemical agent in these bombs would be in the order of about 1,000 tonnes.""<br /><br />Dr. Hans Blix, Chief UN Weapons Inspector<br />Addressing the UN Security Council<br />January 27, 2003<br /><br />---<br /><br />""In the next century, the community of nations may see more and more the very kind of threat Iraq poses now -- a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists, drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the world among us unnoticed.<br /><br />If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow by the knowledge that they can act with impunity, even in the face of a clear message from the United Nations Security Council and clear evidence of a weapons of mass destruction program.""<br /><br />President Clinton<br />Address to Joint Chiefs of Staff and Pentagon staff<br />February 17, 1998<br /><br />---<br /><br />""Iraq is a long way from Ohio, but what happens there matters a great deal here.

"I wanted to like this movie so much but it was too predictable... My husband was the first to get up and leave because he was just annoyed with it. I did my best to stay as long as I could, but the whole gist of the movie lacked logic and substance.<br />Kudos to all the good folks who can sit through the whole movie, my husband and I certainly failed 😊<br />PS: nice special FX!"

Robert Wise is one of the better “Hall Of Fame” directors EVER!🚨 His senses level on a film’s production is astonishing. BLOOD ON THE MOON” is a top level western with a strong touch of Film Noir and it’s a strong fit in Wise’s hands. Mitchum is the perfect tool to transcend both genres and make you feel it. All performances are in the hands of highly skilled performers. What a great movie to relieve the doldrums of most current fare. Most satisfying

"This is a good movie..and just a TAD better then "" the deep blue sea "" because they used  a little to much C.G IN THE UNDER WATER SCEANS..IT ALSO  brings to mind the movie "" CRAWL "" with the crocodiles..but the special features suck..they only show you the story board drawings..and nothing more..and thats A first..AND..IT IS IN FULL-SCREEN.<br />The C.G special effects could have been a little better..BUT all in all it had a good story and a lot of suspence. . So I think<br />It's a good movie to watch more then once ..😊.oh and ps if you want to watch this movie in 3D..YOU WILL NEED THE 3D EQUIPMENT..IF NOT.<br />you can still watch it's regular version on your Blu-ray player..<br />With no problem.. with.excellent picture and sound quality you expect from Blu-ray movies..<br />So ..enjoy..👍👍👍"

"Is this flick the Greatest thriller ever made? No. Nor, is it the finest piece of filmmaking to come around the pike…So, why 5 stars? I’ll keep it simple:  It’s some of the most outright FUN that you can possibly have while watching a movie. It’s Hysterical, w/out being insulting to the viewer, and the ending, you honestly may or may not see coming…But “Dr. X” is a fast-paced, guaranteed GOOD TIME to be had watching any kind of film 🎞—and it’s directed by top notch director of Casablanca, Michael Curtiz!  —todd gold"

This set is PERFECT!  These are the only 2 movies of the series that are any good.  I have the complete set and only like and rewatch the first two.  The rest are lame.  This is the way to get Dirty Harry! 😃👌

"I enjoyed All of It!  I sat on the edge of my seat throughout the movie 🎥!  I laughed when it was humorous, cheered at the formidable battles  and held my breath when death was inevitable! I’ve watched this movie at least  20 times!  (If you want facts read an encyclopedia! The rest us want to see a great movie!"

"This movie was an all time family favorite during Christmas time (and quite frankly year round) growing up in my childhood home; naturally, I expected it to be well recieved when I ordered it as a gift for my 3 and a half year old nephew. Unfortunately, it seems he had the Dickens scared right out of him and is going to finish watching it when he is ready 😅. That seems to be my role in his life, scaring him one 90's movie at a time (last year's pagemaster dvd was also scary but now he loves it).His Mother however was thrilled and loved reliving every comical memory and singing along. I plan to re-order a copy for my own home shortly."

"I bought the DVD to replace my videotape of this movie; I was disappointed that it is NOT the original version. My favorite song is missing, as well as some other scenes! 😠😠"

"If you're looking for the DVD Version that Did Not Cut Out ""When Love Is Gone"" this is it!! The DVD case Does Not show that their are 2 versions on the DVD but there is! Full Screen Version & Widescreen Version. The Full Screen Version has the entire scene, song & the Wide Screen Version does not.<br />They don't make it too easy to find the Full Screen Version!<br /> From the Menu you first select Set-Up.<br />Then you select Audio & Video Options.<br />From there you can then select the Full Screen Version!<br /> If you do like me when I first got the DVD & went straight to scene selection to hear the song it's only going to show the cut out version but the entire scene & song is on the Full Screen Version so don't be dismayed.<br />Of course the picture on this DVD isn't as crisp as the Blu-ray & it doesn't have the Muppets singing Christmas Carols when you pause the Blu-ray but it only has the cut out version of the song!<br /> I read one person here actually stating that the singing wasn't that great 🙄 Maybe Michael Caine wasn't able to sing but the emotion he showed while Belle was singing this beautiful song made up for it & If I had a voice like Belle I would be one very happy female! 😉"

"I haven't received my DVD yet, but after reading the reviews, I'm going to be highly upset if it doesn't have 'The Love Is Gone' song in it!!! That's the main reason I love the movie so much! They should let you know if they cut things out of it!!!<br />Ok I received my movie today, and there's a full screen and a wide, which I guess it's just the wide screen that doesn't have ' the love is gone' song on it. The full screen will say extended version, that will have the song. Ugh I was stressing over nothing,😂"

"The Brits have some appallingly short TV seasons, but when they go ahead with something worth doing, they do it properly.<br /><br />Like a couple of other reviewers who have posted here, I checked this out after hearing a glowing review of Black Mirror on the radio program Studio 360 (Public Radio International). Unlike those viewers who shot it down with 1-star ratings (after watching only the first episode), I found this to be very worthwhile. Perhaps I hold a favorable opinion because I skipped ahead of the ""sex with a pig"" episode (ep.1, ""The National Anthem"") and instead started with ep.3, watching the season in reverse chronological order (viewing order doesn't matter, as the episodes are unconnected). I'd recommend this approach if you are feeling unease about getting thru The National Anthem.<br /><br />I found ep.3, ""The Entire History of You,"" to be insightful and beyond reproach, as well as a fair assessment of what the future holds. If you are a science fiction enthusiast, it hits all the right notes.<br />I'm not sure that I would call this serial ""dark,"" as others are so fond of proclaiming (have they been out of the house lately?) Rather, it is a wary premonition of technology's downside; we have already seen the first indications of privacy becoming a commodity, and a reasoning mind can conclude that this is only the tip of an iceberg. 💣<br /><br />PROs<br />✔ the acting is quite respectable<br />✔ the special effects are nothing to sneeze at<br />✔ the stories are daring and thought-provoking<br /><br />CONs<br />✘ the price is criminal for a set with only 3 episodes<br /><br />Bravo, off to Series 2 I go.<br />UPDATE: After watching Series 2 and then [[ASIN:B00U6QV1TM Black Mirror White Christmas]], I feel confident in stating that Black Mirror is a show that improves with each season. If you are hesitant about starting the serial due to negative comments re: ""The National Anthem,"" then why not start with the best first? Specifically, ""White Christmas,"" followed by Series 2, and finally Series 1; remember, there is no overarching story arc, so the order in which you watch Black Mirror episodes matters not."

"I loved this film, it touched on many genres and was a feel-good time movie night. I knew quickly that I needed it in my Blu-ray collection. Dakota Johnson shines in this role, her best one yet. Tracee Ellis Ross brings the comedy but also takes on a more serious tone while giving off some Diana Ross vibes. The music is really catchy 🎶🎵🎙 🔊 A Comedy, Romance, Drama, must-watch!"
Excellent!  Thank you😊

"What's to be said that hasn't already. The Apple is a godsend to people like myself who enjoy bad movies. It's a spectacular, maniacal train wreck that you cannot help but love. The songs, overall, are actually quite wonderful. Once you hear them, I defy you to get them the heck out of your head. They're tacky yet catchy, over-the-top, literally unforgettable, and the choreography is both wildly creative and visually astonishing (not always astonishing in a good way, but astonishing nonetheless).<br /><br />Nevermind the story, does it need one? The plot, such as it is, is there to frame all those magnificent musical numbers, and that's enough for me.<br /><br />To sum, this is the definition of a cult movie. It's not for everyone. If you've seen an Ed Wood film and turned it off because it was incomprehensible, amateurish crap...you might want to look elsewhere. 😉<br /><br />Long live Alfie and Bibi! 🍎"

"This movie is Horrible!...I don’t think Keene Reeves can act anyway, I just like watching him because he’s hot but he usually have good actors to carry him in a film...not this one! And I didn’t like how he and Winona Ryder were the only ones who had dialogue in the film, that Sucked! because they needed all the help they could get. Wish I could get my money and time back I spent watching or trying to watch this movie UGH!! 😝🥱"

"I stumbled across this one by chance (as opposed to pursuing it for Duff: I had no idea who Hillary Duff was prior to watching this). I enjoyed my first screening so much that I purchased What Goes Up (too bad it's not on Blu-ray) and watched it with a friend who is a director; he was bored and fiddling around with his phone in the beginning, but somewhere in the middle of the film he became engrossed, as I had. It's not one particular event that hooks you, just a buildup where you start to care about the fate of the characters, and a smattering of humor to help it along.<br /><br />Duff did okay in her role as the jailbait character, but really it was the other actors who made the film come together. Although Steve Coogan was excellent, the MVPs of the film might actually have been Sarah Lind (as Peggy Popoladopolous) and Olivia Thirlby (as Tess). One of the most humorous moments I've ever seen in a film occurred with Sarah Lind's character Peggy when she is dropped into a very compromising situation thanks to the half-witted but forgivable character Fenster (played by Max Hoffman aka Woody Focker in [[ASIN:B00ECUAOWS Meet the Fockers]]).<br /><br />Whatever your level of experience as a film aficionado, you've probably not seen anything quite like this one.

I could watch this movie a hundred more times.  It’s absolutely wonderful.  I wanted to respond to the reviewer that said that the storyline for howls moving castle was “not believable”. 😂😂😂. Fair enough.  I don’t think Miyazaki is going for believable.

"I've had this performance since it came out on two discs. At that time, there were problems with the placement of some of the instruments. This redo solved all those problems. The sound is incredible!! This was recorded towards the end of Karajan's career. Without a doubt, it is the finest performance of this symphony on disc. Which brings up all the talk about HVK not being as good as he was in the early days of his career. Hogwash!! In many ways better. There us authority in tbis performance that you don't get from others. Yes, his relationship with Berlin was strained, but that did not stop him from putting out some of his best work. Yes, the tempi were sometimes slower but they never dragged as heard here with the VPO. In his later years, the music seemed more thought-out. His last Beethoven series was the best yet, and, of course, his performances of Tchaikovsky symphonies.<br />John Elliot Gardener was quoted as saying that there was something evil in the way HVK conducted in his last years. Again, hogwash. What we have is a more ""thought-out"" interpretation of the music.<br />Do I sound like a fan? You bet! I consider HVK the greatest conductor of the twentieth century and, thank God he left us with so much to listen to!!🎵🎵🎵"

Okay so I’ll admit this movie is funny. The cuss words used were absolutely stupid. Idk whose idea that was but 🙄. Basically has the same plot point as the first..one parent going off doing illegal super hero work...and the bad guy turns out to be....you will see...when you watch it but it basically goes along the same lines as the first. Jack Jack and Mr. Incredible were the comic relief those two were great. It was definitely something we could watch together as a family and enjoy just isn’t original and not surprising.

"Been a fan of Eminem for 20 years now and this movie is pretty great has some faults yes but I would say 4.5/5💪🏽<br /><br />So don’t listen to these wack 1 or 2 star reviewers 🤦🏽‍♂️ most likely they are haters of Eminem and didn’t even watch the movie.<br /><br />Also Eminem, Dre and Kendrick are performing at the Supwr Bowl in a few days.🙌🏽"

"Lea Seydoux who would later be in James Bond movie Spectre, was special as a Blue Headed forward thinker! Falling in love with another girl and both involved in graphic sex scenes that were on the verge of porn, but overlooking the Graphic Sex😂(yeah right)! You still do get an endearing Romcom with heartbreaking end! Hey I just rewind back to the graphic sex 😜! You should cross your legs watching it!"

I like that two movies are built into one because they don’t take as much storage. I think these are great kids movies that adults can enjoy. I am also satisfied with the shipping nothing was broken at all. I am very satisfied. 👍👍

Now I can watch it whenever I want! I mainly wanted to watch it before the 2nd movie came out on LMN! To my surprise The Bad Seed Returns was pulled off the tv guide because of the shooting in Texas. 😢
"Classic movie. Huge fan of the franchise, but the overall quality is very poor. I mean this is supposed to be bluray, but it looks like straight vhs to dvd. Pretty disappointed 😞"

Great movie! Lou D. Phillips at his his best! This flick used to Scared the stew outta me as a kid and still holds up as a great movie for suspense and thriller today. I miss the 90's 💯

"Incredible movie! This is actual proof that the critics don’t know what a good movie is. Seen this movie before purchasing and even better the second time- the plot is brilliant....finally a girl about to be victimized gets revenge. The color scheme, the lighting, the visuals just dazzle. This movie may not be for everyone though if you relish the tables turning in the most creative way-  this flick if for you! 👍"

"Arrow Video has absolutely out done themselves with this remaster! Simple beautiful and handled with oh so much tender love and care. Gotta love that 4K Rescan!!! 😍 The story is a Solid 8.5/10 and with a boat load of catchy one liners to boot though be aware of the high amounts of vulgarity and derrogatory terms. Filled to the brim with Bonus Features and all sorts of goodies. The Blu Ray is Region B so you will need a Region Free Player but besides that, pick this up! You won't regret it!!"

"PROs<br />✔ A tale steeped in inter and intrapersonal conflicts (often borne out of political ones) with a twisty plot tying characters together usually on more than one level. This is a narrative of divided loyalties, which leads to some tricky relationships.<br />✔ Indian Summers successfully transports you back in time, which is naturally of paramount importance for historical fiction.<br />✔ The writers don't pull their punches; the disparaging attitude of the Brits towards the Indians is captured unflinchingly.<br />✔ Indian Summers was renewed for a second season, so feel free to get attached to the characters.<br />✔ The actors! Jemima West was my primary motivation for ordering the DVD as soon as it became available in the UK, and lucky us: she is Alice, sister to the central British character, Ralph (Henry Lloyd-Hughes). I was pleased to meet Amber Rose Revah as Leena Prasad, who is easily more telegenic than 90% of Hollywood's actresses. Plus some handsome fellas, if that's your thing. In contrast to her placement on the cover art, the role of Julie Walters is not front and center, although her character is a socialite at the center of the web.<br />✔ Indian Summers is likelier to make you want to crack open a history book to learn more than is Downton Abbey.<br /><br />CONs<br />✘ It was shot in Malaysia, not India. While I didn't mind this commonplace inconsistency (if I had a buck for every production filmed in a location different from the one it portrayed, I'd be able to retire), this choice apparently has garnered wrath in some quarters.<br /><br />📀 I purchased this season on Amazon's UK site, regrettably before I became aware of the Blu-ray release. The picture quality of the UK-released [Region 2] DVD set is disappointing. The US [Region 1] DVD release, which has the PBS ribbon across the top of the cover, is encoded differently than the UK release (it's on 4 discs rather than 3) so *may* have a superior picture. I will probably buy the Blu-ray for a second viewing of the season.<br /><br />📀 From the back cover of the DVD:<br />&#34;The year is 1932, the place is India, and the people are romanticized, politicized, and radicalized. They are drawn together and driven apart by class, race, love and theft, and the world around them is changing. In the small British colony of Simla, placed at the foothills of the Himalayas, the beliefs of the British Empire still remain but the young are hungry for freedom.<br />Indian Summers tells a sweeping saga; stories of love, secrets, promises made and broken, and tensions that simmer in the hot, feverish days and nights of India -- an India populated by freedom fighters, star-crossed lovers, political spies, artists, orphans, expats, the rich and the poor.&#34;"

"I liked the movie it grabbed my attention. The camera work was great! I got lost at the end. Not sure if Tara and the detective were trying to stop those doing the experiments, and who was the girl at the end? Fyi...just realized Judy Norton played the eldest daughter in the Waltons ! She wrote this flick.👏"

....... It freaked me out! 😂 More than I thought it would. Best Halloween movie made
"Halloween is my favorite horror franchise and this film is the best one since the original two films. I will say that I wasn’t happy that once again Halloween retconned other films and especially eliminating Halloween II (1981) which is my favorite of the series.<br /><br />However, I was enthralled in the story and the kills. Seeing Jamie Lee Curtis back and her character being complexed with her relationships and her obsession with Michael Myers, who was emancipated from the family for this film, which I was also annoyed by.<br /><br />This trilogy of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode’s last stands is something I have looked forward to. The writing is great and is very self aware while also having levity without being corny. The directing is also fantastic and keeps the pace going, giving scares when the audience gets too relaxed and the climax is very menacing and does the Shape proud.<br /><br />The film entertains and with the knowledge of Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends (are these seriously the titles???) we know that for a little while we will see more Michael Myers roaming Haddonfield in search of his sister...I mean victim? I am glad for that and with Blumhouse producing it...they’ll be classics for sure! My hope is that Blumhouse can make an appropriately fitting remake of the original in 2028 for the 50th anniversary and allow Halloween to RIP 🪦"

1)The box it came in was not the same as the one shown. 2)It said it had audio in Spanish. Surprise this one that was sent did not 😟3)There is no 3 really. The only reason it got even 1 star from me is because it plays on a portable dvd I just bought.

"I was very much excited to see this as the trailer was continuesly being shown on my Facebook feed. The comments were great, most saying how funny the movie was. I don't know I didn't find it all that funny. The funniest parts were shown on the trailer, you know the green balls, peas. I love this genre and thought I knew what to basically expect I was extremely disappointed. I just expected so much more from all the hype. The acting was for the most part ok I am not giving the run down on that. Well to each their own as they say. 👎🏻"

"Went to see Valerian at its theatrical release, and was disappointed. True, the chemistry between Valerian and Laureline is whispy at best, but I decided to purchase it on bluray anyway. Glad I did, as the movie was incredibly better the second time around. The visuals are astoundingly off the charts, crazy beautiful! The acting is good, though not great. Bigger named actors would have saved this box office tragedy from financial suicide. Regardless, it's a shame it didn't do better. Industrial Lights & Magic provided the fantastic &#34;eye candy&#34;. As I said, if you can excuse some of the mediocre acting, focus on the story and visuals...well then you've got one hell of an entertaining ride to enjoy, and enjoy you will! Highly recommended! 😸🎨🎸👍🏼"

This is a really funny movie 🍿🎥🍿🎥<br /><br />A lot of people don't know but Tupac Shakur is in this movie<br />Only for about 5 minutes but he is<br /><br />And there's nothing like an old judge with a penis for a nose

"It's not Martyrs 2 but it's close. It's directed by the same director who did Martyrs. Take two sisters as well as their mother, who get tormented and tortured by 2 crazy whackos! along with an bizarre  story it may sound strange or unpleasant, but it's a well made different kind of horror film. It really is a pretty wild and crazy film that actually makes you use your head and think with its twist. You can actually enjoy this horror movie much more than martyrs, because it is no where near as brutal and extreme as martyrs is, but it is rather brutal! For true horror hounds looking for something different, but well made. 👹"

Was unaware it wasn’t original voices. Kids lost interest immediately. Just not the same childhood memories without those animated voices. But on technical side- it arrived on time. Not damaged. So 🤷🏻‍♀️

"I recently saw this movie for the first time when my local theater did a Studio Ghibli fest. I went home and purchased the DVD immediately because it was that good. I am lowkey upset that I hadn't seen it as a child because I would have appreciated it way more.<br /> the quality of the DVD itself is legit, it's great.<br /> As for the movie, one of THE BEST. It's a wonderfully pure movie great for kids and adults of any age. Though, my boyfriend thinks it's childish. Though I agree to some extent, I don't care 😛"

Cute movie.<br />One bath scene with the dad and daughters we did not like. Probably common in Japanese culture.<br />We did not keep for family. 🙂

Such a cute movie. It’s like Mary Poppins but only if Mary Poppins was a giant fuzzy creature who had crazy eyes 😂 It’s my sisters favorite movie 🍿

"Hello, This may be a true version of how it was; in the 1800's, France. Black & White, shows poverty & having nothing; very hard with the belief in god, could get yourself in deep poo. The actors were very convincing of the story! It was beautiful torture❣️😇 Holier than thou, be praised🧚🏽‍♀️"

I’m in the middle of nowhere Alaska and this message keeps popping up halfway through the movie. It keeps muting the movie and saying it has muted it and is unable to play sound on my device... I’ve never ever had this happen with a movie before... what is going on? I’m livid! It’s right in the middle of a freaking good movie I’ve never seen before 🤬

"To whomever receives this Message/Review:<br /><br />Even though I do receive the item by tomorrow (Thurs, Apr 7), I do wish to say Thank You for this wonderful gift. Funny thing is I happen to ALREADY own a DVD copy of this movie, same exact Special Edition DVD and all, but as a paranoid movie–buff, I just couldn't help myself but to buy a Second Copy (for ""Emergency Measures"" for in case the first copy starts to freeze or stop working). I can definitely say that 'Total Recall' is my #1 all–time favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movie ever (since I first saw it at age 13 on DVD), everything about it is pitch–perfect; it's got Arnie as the hero, it's also got sci–fi action–adventure, a Bourne Identity–style identity mystery, a sinister Corporate Conspiracy, underdog Rebels vs. a Corporate Tyrant, alien artifacts that can terraform Mars, the Paul Verhoeven violence and sociopolitical satire, the Philip K. Dick–style question of 'Reality vs. Fantasy', etc. What more could I ask for?<br /><br />So once again, I Thank You for allowing me to but a Second Copy of 'TOTAL RECALL'. And in the words of Arnold: ""Get Your Ass to Mars."" Lol  😉 😀"

"I bought this movie to encourage my daughter.  She said she "" will watch it"", begrudgingly.  She's 12 and moody sometimes.  However,  the whole family happened to start watching it. IT IS AMAZING, INSPIRATIONAL, and heartwarming.  My entire family loved it. Caught my hubby/ son with watery eyes 😳. So pleasantly surprised how everyone in family loved it. Highly recommend this movie."
I loved this Movie very much it's a Masterpiece you want to stand up and cheer. The Kendrick Brothers are amazing I loved War Room too! I highly recommend it.<br />Valerie Lambert😊🙏🏼✝️❤️
Great movie 👍 inspiring
"Overcomer is my favorite Sherwood Pictures movie! Love them all for exceptional story, inspiring and encouraging message,  casting, directing, filming quality second to none! Overcomer a wonderful message of who we are in Christ and how we as the redeemed people of the LORD, can overcome any trial or hardship and accomplish our dreams while helping others achieve at the same time! A+++🙏🙏🙏✝️💪💝"
"I am a Christian who doesn’t typically like Christian movies. Often too cheesy.<br />These 5 movies, every single one are fantastic! I saw each one when it came out and loved them. Then I bought this set for my Mom who is 83 years old so we can watch them together. We have watched each one and with each one I remembered why I loved it! And when each movie was ending my Mom said through tears “I don’t want it to end”! She loves them that much.<br />They are true to life, touching and inspiring. No cheese! 😊"

"A GREAT Video Game-to-Film adaptation that should serve as an example to other film makers on how to make a Live Action film based on a video game! The plot is sufficient and the stars and action sequences are impeccable in its similarity to the actual game! If you're a fan of the Dead or Alive Game Series, you should also add this one to your collection. If you're not familiar with the series, but do enjoy a light-hearted action film with a sprinkle of comedic moments while not sacrificing the seriousness of the plot itself, this should also please you, as well! 😎<br /><br />I also love the fact that the 'violence' isn't the least bit graphic. No blood shed at all, and a very fun film! 😄"

"I bought this for my two year old daughter because she loves it and they recently pulled it off Netflix. She asked me every day for three days “Where penguinzzzz goooooo???” So i had to buy it obviously. It has some really funny dad-jokes, the animation is top notch, and it’s just a funny goofy movie all around. And for $8, it was a total bargain for a DVD/Bluray combo pack. We are watching it right now as i’m writing this…and most likely re-watching it as YOU are reading this😳🫣haha"

Simon Baker is the main character in this film and in the series. I own the whole series of the Mentalist on DVD. He is a great 👍 actor and this is a terrific series.
The movie was absolutely brilliant!!! With a fresh new take on a mondern day anti- hero vs evil! With a chilling & scene stilling performance by Dule Hill as Angelo!!! The greatest touch to this movie was the reference paid homage to the great Houdini....🔮. A must see by all movie fans everywhere!!!!😆👍📽

The disc is made in Mexico and will not work with American systems. SO disappointing. I was so excited for the price and yet the disc zip code doesn’t match the systems 💀 HORRIFIC. Will not do this again.

Very impressed by this movie. Great cast and something very different than the norm. A bit of a slow burn but you never lose interest.  It is very interesting to watch how the event effects each family member differently. Very well shot with unique colorization and a bit of crazy Cage that I always enjoy 😉

"I REALLY HATE THIS MOVIE! IF they paid as much attention to the scientific  parts as they did the stupid special effects, it would have been a really good movie. EVERTHING they did getting into space and while in space was all utter 🐂💩!! EVERY bit of it was wrong and flat out impossible. Like the side by side launch of two Shuttles. That's something that they would NEVER do. Cuz if one screwed up both of them would blow up.<br />  The Russian space station that they ""spin up to have gravity"" is 🐂💩. That design of a space station would rip itself apart if you tried to do that with it. And the way they did it the Shuttles would have to chase it around in circles to get connected to it. Which would be impossible to do in space. And the direction that they had it spinning was 90° off for them to walk through it. The way it was spinning they would have had to climb a ladder up through it. Which doesn't matter because it didn't matter which axes they spun it on, it would rip it apart to spin it in any direction.<br />  Then they go ""flying"" the Shuttles through space like they were flying airplanes in ""atmosphere"" when THEY WERE IN SPACE, A VACUUM"" as in NO FLIPPIN AIR""!<br />  THEN they go hauling ass over the asteroid, with rocket engine's going full blast, swooping around, again as if they were flying airplanes.<br />  And the stupidest thing are the little thrusters on thier shoulder that are supposed to keep them from floating away off the asteroid. Like, really? There's no atmosphere on the asteroid to use in the ""thrusters"" so they would have to use compressed gas of some sort. And it would be impossible for them to carry enough of it to last more than a few minutes.<br />  And what the heck did they have a 20mm gatling gun for? Incase they ran into some Aliens on the asteroid and they wanted to start a war with them?<br />  And they didn't even have the bits on the drill rig right at the start of it all.<br />  Those are just a few of the worst screwed up things in the movie. They didn't get anything right in that whole stupid movie. If they even put half of the attention to the science part as they did on the stupid special effects, it could have been a really good movie. Its like the people making the movie didn't know anything about space and completely ignored reality by treating everybody as being as ignorant about space as they are.<br />  I can't even watch the stupid thing. It tics me off the way they think people are so stupid that none of us would notice how wrong they got everything.<br />  On that last part, I guess I'm wrong. Otherwise it wouldn't have a 5 star rating. That just shows there is an awful lot of stupid people out there!!"

Which doesn't matter because it didn't matter which axes they spun it on, it would rip it apart to spin it in any direction.<br />  Then they go ""flying"" the Shuttles through space like they were flying airplanes in ""atmosphere"" when THEY WERE IN SPACE, A VACUUM"" as in NO FLIPPIN AIR""!<br />  THEN they go hauling ass over the asteroid, with rocket engine's going full blast, swooping around, again as if they were flying airplanes.<br />  And the stupidest thing are the little thrusters on thier shoulder that are supposed to keep them from floating away off the asteroid. Like, really? There's no atmosphere on the asteroid to use in the ""thrusters"" so they would have to use compressed gas of some sort. And it would be impossible for them to carry enough of it to last more than a few minutes.<br />  And what the heck did they have a 20mm gatling gun for? Incase they ran into some Aliens on the asteroid and they wanted to start a war with them?<br />  And they didn't even have the bits on the drill rig right at the start of it all.<br />  Those are just a few of the worst screwed up things in the movie. They didn't get anything right in that whole stupid movie. If they even put half of the attention to the science part as they did on the stupid special effects, it could have been a really good movie. Its like the people making the movie didn't know anything about space and completely ignored reality by treating everybody as being as ignorant about space as they are.<br />  I can't even watch the stupid thing. It tics me off the way they think people are so stupid that none of us would notice how wrong they got everything.<br />  On that last part, I guess I'm wrong. Otherwise it wouldn't have a 5 star rating. That just shows there is an awful lot of stupid people out there!!"

"I liked movie because it was silly. I really did laugh. Some of my friends were bored by it, but it's NOT MEANT TO BE SERIOUS.  Was a cute story about best friends.<br />I was surprised to realize the male lead was the sexy male from ' FIFTY SHADES MOVIES SERIES.<br />I buy movies to be entertained and laugh so it did just that. I would give it a full 5 stars 🌟 but I am usually not in the main stream taste with views. Enjoy the gorgeous landscapes atleast."

"When my package arrived  it was open, looked like It was done with a blade. The guy who delivered it gave it to me like that.<br />I was happy my dvd was in there but my dvd cover n case was slashed  too.<br />Not cool.<br />Overall the dvd 📀 itself was not damage and the kids enjoyed the movie."

The disc is in great condition no issue there. The only problem is a corner part in the bottom to close the case broke so only the top closes but it’s not much of an issue. Overall a great purchase! 👍🏻

"History Of The World Part 1 (never a part 2 … as it turns out that is kinda funny too, whether a sequel was ever really planned or not…) was the first time I ever saw Gregory Hines (pretty darn cool, funny, and cowardly In History World Part 1) and his Ethiopian Shim Sham soft shoe dance performance—in an attempt to be spared from the Roman Lions—made me a fan of Hines almost immediately.<br />I saw the sophomoric, sometimes offensive humor of History Part 1 the summer before attending high school and I pretty much laughed like a soon to be sophomore would at the dirty jokes and the Trojan condom reference, to the groan inducing visual of the Roman soldiers are everywhere:  (actually) ‘Crawling in the streets!’<br />And how many times did we as teenagers quote with an impish grin:  ‘It’s good to be the king!’<br />Also, in the French Revolution the chess match with real people dressed as the pieces, inspiring the king’s famed line, indeed.<br />Most importantly to me is the hilarious and probably offensive to too many the Spanish Inquisition musical number with an Esther Williams swim sequence complete with appropriately clad nuns in bathing suits.<br />Good memories yes some jokes are duds but, still, why take it too seriously.  As good as Blazing Saddles was I was always a bit surprised History Of The World generally got reviews that were much more scathing than Mel Brooks’ raunchy western parody (mel brooks killed the fart joke, no 🙃).<br />Gloris Leachman (In over the top poor French Revolutionary makeup and THAT thick accent too …) and Madelyn Kahn (speaking in sex tongue innuendo …) both steal a scene or two.<br />A comic History of a sometimes hypocritical and flawed World worthy of 4 stars and, certainly, not deserving of much better.<br />Look for a bevy of cameos from tv stars at the time including Bea ‘Maude’ Arthur and Ron Carey from Barney Miller fame etc.  Mel got ol’ timer Shecky Greene to make an appearance, also.<br />Like I said good early 80s memories and silly slapstick with a Roman chariot chase to please the Cheech and Chong(?) fans.<br />Check out the size of that doobie."

"If I could give this film ten stars on a five star scale I would - it's just that good. It truly deserves best picture, best director (Ridley Scott), best actor (Matt Damon), best supporting actress (Jessica Chastain), best screenplay, best novel/story (may not be a category but Andy Weir deserves credit for the story), and best special effects. The rest of the cast were also superb, but there are only so many awards to go around! 😉 Now that that's out of the way, I will add few more comments. The screenwriter was quoted as saying &#34;&#34;The Martian&#34; (script) was a love letter to science.&#34; It was that and so much more. It was also a testament to the triumph of the human spirit on a personal basis as manifested by Matt Damon's performance, and also the collective spirit of both NASA and all mankind rising to the challenge of &#34;bringing him home&#34;. It showed us our best selves without being saccharine, and hopefully will inspire our nation and younger viewers to pursue the sciences in school and in their careers. Smart, dedicated people collectively working towards something bigger than themselves were the heroes; indeed, science and intelligent people with a can do attitude are the uncredited stars. My optimistic hope is that the book and movie may grab America by its collective shoulders, shake vigorously, and wake us up from our national malaise to restart/fund our space and STEM education programs with the objective of an extended manned Mars and planetary exploration program! Yes, these are high hopes for lasting change started by a mere movie, but then, why not?!? Show it in our schools to inspire the young. Instead of seeing the movie and thinking &#34;that used to be us&#34;, my hope is that people walk out of the theater thinking &#34;that's going to be us again!&#34; Bravo to everyone associated with the film; it is a masterpiece!!!"

"‪A supremely confident origin film with a charming and vibrant Brie Larson kicking butt and having a great time. I am now a huge fan. <br /><br />Stoked to finally have Carol Danvers on board with the Avengers. I can't wait to see this character develop more with a stronger script and Goose by her side. Captain Brie and Samuel L Jackson giving me The Long Kiss Goodnight sequel we all deserved! Love their chemistry and my new Captain<br /><br />Congrats on the huge Box Office success!<br />Higher, Further, Faster baby 🤙🏼"

"I purchased this movie to complete my Marvel Cinematic universe collection. As these types of high budget films go. The CG was on spot. The flow was good, character timing was good. The movie flowed. The supporting cast members did a great job. Larson was extremely 1 & 2 dimensional. I wasn't satisfied with her skill set. She has a tendency to emote like a deer in the headlights stare. I would have liked to have seen Katherine Winneck in this role. She's a trained fighter and very athletic. Along with crazy easy on the eyes.<br />  I would have given this a 5 🌟 rating except for Larson's sub-par acting skill. Perhaps she feels she's so gorgeous that her looks get her over that low bar. She ain't that beautiful. By any means. She's more woke than pretty. In any event the collection is complete. If you are a fan go ahead get it. If not rent it.<br />  When I'm off for a good amount of time I'll sequentially watch them all for a full effect & understanding. Capt Marvel will be backfill as to character placement in the overall scheme of things. Take care be safe."

Brilliant!!! Does not deviate from the book. The casting is great too. I loved the book & now I love the movie. Might pay to invest in some tissues though 😊

"If you can accept god as a black woman and the loss of a kidnapped child, then this movie is for you. Much more of an adult movie but leave you with renewed faith in the holy trinity and touch your heart. Very fine movie, well acted and with a spiritual message that hits home in today’s troubled times.You will become a believer after watching this movie from beginning to end.👍"

I ordered this for my mom because she didnt have a blue ray player so I couldnt loan her my movie. I got it so fast and it cost only 5.00! She and I absolutely loved this movie. Absolutely worth it!😊

"My favorite Godzilla films are the classics. The 1954 original (the Japanese cut being my preferred version), Raids Again, Mothra Vs. Godzilla, Ghidorah: The Three-Headed Monster (that one being my favorite Godzilla film of all time) and everyone knows just how terrible those classics were. Everyone hates them. Thats why Godzilla became the most popular Japanese film franchise to hit US shores. I mean, the American 1998 was the greatest and most successful Godzilla film of all time. It was a critical and commercial success, so great they could not make any sequels to it. You can run a poll and more people would say they would rather re-watch the 1998 or 2014 Americanized Godzilla films over any of the Toho classics from the 50s and 60s. If you like those old films, you're not a true Godzilla fan. That's why I prefer the old ones. I'm just an old carmedgeom who just hates everything and is out of touch with what is good and not. That's why I hated Shin Godzilla and even cite it as a contributing cause as to why I no longer go to the movie theatre and waste my time and money anymore. (I drove a hour to the closest theatre that was showing this) I mean, who in their right mind wants to see Godzilla battle another monster. That's just SO outdated! No one would ever go see that! Godzilla teaming up with Mothra and Rodan to defeat King Ghidorah and who the hell wants to see the little twin girls in another movie. That's not hip enough for this current demographic. This is the best Godzilla film ever made which is why I truly hated it. Most of the film was spent relaying a political message which is why people go to see movies. Name anyone you know who goes to see movies for entertainment anymore. It just does not happen. You're a weirdo if that's what you do. This re-boot of Godzilla is so divinely perfect originals were scrapped as if they never were made. That just shows you how great this is! We don't want movies full of fun monster battles. We are more interested in knowing if the government has permission to use missiles on a giant monster that's destroying the city and killing people. That's entertainment! That's true Godzilla! And I'm just old and obsolete! 😆😆😆"

"3 of my favorites... Gary Oldman, Toby Stephens and GERARD BUTLER! (& Nyquist RIP)<br /> I understand others may think, or may actually know, that some actions taken by officers in the movie are not SOP but... it’s a movie! It’s a fresh look at dealing with difficult situations! Just like in ‘Hunt for the Red October’, where the events portrayed ‘never happened’, this film brings to light that - who knew? - we’re all HUMAN and THAT is what indeed IS important!<br />Love the movie; watch it almost as often as Red Oct... maybe more often... yeah... at least once a week... btb, also recommend The Vanishing (Keepers)😁"

I have always been a fan of a good cat and mouse submarine movie. Just being on a submarine is more than most will ever be able to fathom . Sure ... there is a lot of fictional situations in the movie that more than likely would not happen in real life situation .  But movies are only made for entertainment ... and as far as entertainment I’ll give it a total thumbs up definitely keep you on the edge of your seat it is well-made . As far as the packaging goes for both the DVD and Blu-ray copy .. it’s As far as the packaging goes for both the DVD and Blu-ray cop fine (despite what some have complained) .. I like the fact that it’s a simple Blu-ray case were two CDs in it thst are separated on the front and back of the actual case . No I played both CDs in my American Blu-ray player and they both played perfectly fine and everything worked . What is a good price for a good movie . Kind of hard to beat .. I don’t care what anyone else says . 🤙

Stop reading the reviews and buy this documentary film about a woman.....I mean childish girl who doesn't know how to be in a committed relationship. Funny how I didn't know about her other exes until I saw this film. What's worse is that I wasn't even mentioned in the film which hurt even worse. But it's okay. My head is held high and the tears have ceased. You do you boo. You do you.<br /><br />😭

"Paul Newman in a role.named.after his acting ability, thick like a brick. Elizabeth Taylor as the cat in the hat in heat. Brick and 🐱 relationship is Rocky and hit the bricks. She like took comfort in another then our meathead of a leading man. Brick just can't get over the betrayal and proceeded to make 🐱 feel like the contents of a kitty litter box. The family's dynamics are just jaw dropping, dysfunctional, and sad. I sat through this dreck,.and at the end was.gratefully appreciative of indeed ended. Not before bricks.store finally drop,.and demands 🐱go upstairs and perform her marital duties. You can't make this stuff up. The movie, while boring and had no point. It is old fashioned, sexist, the type of movie Hollywood would never make today. For being so bold, I gladly award this movie a whopping 3 whole stars."

"Oh the charm of youth!  These bad boys of the upper class USA in 1991 are jean-clad kids at a private boarding school, The Rejects school.  Well ok it is supposed To be Regis School. Their fathers are very high level government and corporate men.<br />They rebel<br />By smoking and drinking and hiding under the big kitchen in an old cellar, even daring to hook up their Radio Shack phone on the school<br />Phone wires so they can call for phone sex.  Ach these bad boys in their rolled up t-shirt sleeves and tight pants!<br /><br />Suddenly at lunch the school is taken over by a Columbian druglord's  son and his compadres with machine guns.  He is one bad hombre and mad as hell because his father had been arrested and sentenced by one of the kids' father, a federal judge.  So mr kingpin jr will kill everyone if his demands are not met:  release his father.<br /><br />These boys turn out to be a more clever and braver bunch that these Spanish-muttering slimy  types reckoned with.  They won't take their impending death and imprisonment lying down!<br /><br />Through well-planned intelligence gathering put together into a notebook, such as using a yearbook photo of the school building to show where each terroriist is located, and where the escape route underground is... which leads to that kitchen cellar...the boys smuggle the intel binder out to the FBI and marines stationed outside unwilling to negotiate with terrirists.  But ready with full blast military force!!! Including helicopters.<br /><br />What viewers may enjoy is the sheer audacity of these clever boys and the defeat of the nasty drug pusher Columbians, - a real David and Goliath story.  Especially since Sean Astin, son of Patty Duke, is a short and dorky looking fellow, yet the most agile and determined and wiliest of all!  He reminded me a bit of the young Mickey Rooney.<br /><br />And there is no girl to get In the end so some would say girls wouldn't care for the film.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing the loose clothes and fluffed up hair of the 1980's on these boys.  Also I loved the fact that there were no cellphones or computers. Just plain old 📚!  And notebooks and sketch pads to get information transmitted out ....<br /><br />I also loved how the school just kept running with meals and play time and bells ringing and so on.  Would lowlifes from Columbia really let their captives be free or thrown them into the auditorium and lock the doors?  Sandwiches if they were lucky!<br /><br />But never mind mundane reality.  There is enough real violence and death 💀 to make the film engaging.  One boy dies just as he is about to be released, simply because he fights the Columbian man leading him out to the gate and his VIP father.<br /><br />Enjoy a bit of nostalgia for pre electronics!"

A tour de force and without John Wayne! Alan Ladd shines from the beginning to the grand finale. Everyone played there part with a grand performance. Jack Palance was young and raw in his role as the menacing gunslinger opposite of Alan Ladd who was even a better gunslinger being the star movie 🍿. Alan Ladd overall didn’t have to steal the show. He was the show with the help of other great performers.

UNFORTUNATELY it is passed the return window for a return so we are stuck with this blu-ray! 😡 I’m going to try and reach out to Amazon and see if they will exchange for English version?!"

We received only the bonus disc and not the actual film.  It was sealed in plastic and the case does not appear to be designed to hold 2 discs.  I cannot account for how this may have happened.  Returning and ordering again.  😕

"My 9yo son has watched this movie six times in the few days we have had it and gas plans for several family movie dates around it.  As a child of the 80s, I laughed hard at the countless pop culture references.  The takes place in an apocolyptic world after the invasion of the Duplos.  The characters work hard at their goth or brooding personas.  Very cute and funny movie with ear worm songs (forget frozen).  Everything is awesome😉"

"Another Movie from Video ? Well sorta on this part one of two movie's. Agent #47 trained from birth to do one thing only, kill bad people that other bad people feel the world would be better off without. And Agent #47 is the best of the best. This movie is full of fast action, high body count & a chase that's been going on for three year's. ( from here onward I will not spoil the plot for you )<br />The main actor Timothy Olyphant dose a great job by taking on the part of Agent #47 with style. He take's what should be a Mentally Mechanical Engineered  type person and shows that deep down the agent has a heart & even a sense of humor (although dark) but still humor. In many ways his action's are as machine like as any human being could possibly be but, at the same time I see his cold showers & avoidance of sex not much different then a Prize Fighter in Training for his next big fight.<br />In short, it's a Hit Man type movie with many twist with the action being endless & enough realish scene's to keep you glued to the screen. As for collateral damage, it is there & not hidden as in most movie's of this type. But the official's that have been chasing agent 47 for three year's shows that all the collateral damages could of been avoided.<br />Outstanding balance & acting from every player in this cast of caractors, but especially from Olyphant. I've seen my share of Hit Men / Mechanic's / Paid Assassin's based movie's but I must put this one at the Top of my List of Favorite's. Mr. Olyphant really dose a great role of Agent #47 and I'm not certain of the input or adlibbing he was allowed to do, but he really manages to give a raised from birth pefectionest best at his trade Hitman a heart with emotions that should not be present but are slipped in here & there which proves there's hope for humanity no matter what.<br />I hope you enjoy The Movie & I will advise you to purchase this one rather then streaming because it is one of those movie's that you will want to revisit from time to time. And as promised, I left the plot intact cause I hate reading reviews that go to far into movie's, to the point where you have to ask yourself, why should I watch it ? The reviewer just gave up everything including the plot ! 😎"

As for collateral damage, it is there & not hidden as in most movie's of this type. But the official's that have been chasing agent 47 for three year's shows that all the collateral damages could of been avoided.<br />Outstanding balance & acting from every player in this cast of caractors, but especially from Olyphant. I've seen my share of Hit Men / Mechanic's / Paid Assassin's based movie's but I must put this one at the Top of my List of Favorite's. Mr. Olyphant really dose a great role of Agent #47 and I'm not certain of the input or adlibbing he was allowed to do, but he really manages to give a raised from birth pefectionest best at his trade Hitman a heart with emotions that should not be present but are slipped in here & there which proves there's hope for humanity no matter what.<br />I hope you enjoy The Movie & I will advise you to purchase this one rather then streaming because it is one of those movie's that you will want to revisit from time to time. And as promised, I left the plot intact cause I hate reading reviews that go to far into movie's, to the point where you have to ask yourself, why should I watch it ? The reviewer just gave up everything including the plot ! 😎"

"Was really excited to watch my favorite childhood movie with my 2 year old, unfortunately the disk was scratched right out of the package and skipped in my DVD players 😔 I didn't bother to return the product because for $5 I really didn't want to go through the hassle. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because the product was shipped out promptly and arrived quickly."

"This is the Godzilla film I’ve been waiting for since I fell in love with Godzilla as a kid. It’s absolute perfect as far as I’m concerned. If your familiar with the history of Godzilla at all you’re in for a special treat because Michael Dougherty is a true fan. If you aren’t familiar with big G, then sit back and enjoy the ride... but try not to take things too seriously. This is a Kaiju movie after all. 😁"

I saw this movie when I was in grammar school. I couldn't get enough of it. Now finally as a adult I can own it for the right place! What a life for both Mommie N Christina ( the daughter) I wonder how true the stuff in here is. But regardless I GAVE IT 5 ⭐🌟🌟🌟🌟

Chris Pratt is a True Star!!  J World has a good story and great character development  with top grade C. G. I.  Nice tech tools creating a futuristic feel. A Must See!! 🎥🎥🎥

"Blu-ray makes THE OUTLAW and Jane Russell look and seem better than ever, but that’s it. Hughes should have found a better director, scriptwriter and music coordinator to make it a “must see”. Best thing about it is THAT POSTER!🤓"

"It could not play in Africa due to region restrictions. Why should you put restrictions on the Word of GOD when JESUS commissioned us to proclaim His Word to the ends of the earth??? At least if you could put a warning on the restricted movies. We are living in the last days Matthew 24, Revelation chapters 9, 13, 14... and this is the right time to spread the gospel before the resurrection of the church and the mark of the beast 666 (the rule of the Anti-Christ)🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼."

"A modern tale using the famous story of “The Sword and The Stone” and “King Arthur and The Knights of the Round Table” as inspiration for this Uniquely action packed Adventure! The Movie is truly engaging providing lots of funny moments, intertwined with some heart warming relatable life lessons as well. In this film the main characters are kids who undergo transformations as the story progresses. The kids are the Heroes and their journeys and back stories are well written into the famous Tale of King Arthur & the Sword in the Stone. Great special effects combine with terrific performances by both seasoned and young actors alike! Our entire Family Loved it!<br />Note: Best for kids 7yrs and up. Some “Creatures” are so well crafted they might be a touch scary for really young children. But overall, it was a refreshingly Unique Movie!!! 👍👍👍"

"This was one of his more underrated,but cooler roles from his heyday.Kind of a bad cop to an extent,but when it got real he showed what a good cop he actually was.Unfortunately had to for his past.Still a great Cage flick.Not saying this is a sad ending but they can’t always be happy endings.That would not be real life.❤️😀"

Have seen many movies on Emma & enjoyed them all. This one is the same story with a little different view. She’s portrayed as more entitled & self-centered than some versions but does come to self-realization in the end and everyone lives happily ever after 💗

I guess everyone has their opinions and their own tastes but this was and STILL is one of my favorite movies! The slow build up the dialogue the tension throughout the movie as everything gets stranger and links and discoveries are made to the way the people are taken over that dreadfully suspenseful music  all the way to the climatic end as they show the dark side of the moon 🌚 with all the remants of the lost planes and ships and the mayday screams we are drifting toward b140. It was a well done movie for it's time that STILL stands. It held me as much now as it did back then. A great addition to my horror collection that I'll be watching more than once! It's either for you or it's not. But it was a great watch for me!

The slow build up the dialogue the tension throughout the movie as everything gets stranger and links and discoveries are made to the way the people are taken over that dreadfully suspenseful music  all the way to the climatic end as they show the dark side of the moon 🌚 with all the remants of the lost planes and ships and the mayday screams we are drifting toward b140. It was a well done movie for it's time that STILL stands. It held me as much now as it did back then. A great addition to my horror collection that I'll be watching more than once! It's either for you or it's not. But it was a great watch for me!

I was a teenager when Ferngully came out in 1992. I actually won passes from Fox to go to a pre-screening in April of that year. I still have one of the passes as well as the promotional book and other goodies. The movie should have been more popular in my opinion and the initial blu-ray release was not that good. I was excited to see Shout Factory got the rights to Ferngully and will be releasing the 30th anniversary edition blu ray which I know will be a lot better! 💙 Ferngully is one of the best animated movies of all time.

"I bought the movie in store rather than Amazon but same difference. Funimation did right firing a kid diddler that's had accusations over ten years back. And for all the people curious or complaining, his name is still listed in the credits of the film. Anyone saying otherwise is lying for the drama. Funi didn't screw over any workers or customers with any of its handling or releases. Fans of ONE voice actor are just too caught up in defending him rather than seeing what the entire company stood its ground on. 5 stars to Funimation. Can't wait to see who replaces Broly, fingers crossed for Patrick Seitz 👌🏻"

I rate it 10/10... Since the movie been out in theaters I've seen it 4 times already. I must say this is the best Dragon Ball I've ever seen in my life. Akira Toriyama you did it again. I've felt like a big kid watching this movie and I'm 30 years old 😂. Keep bringing us more Dragon Ball.

"I love both of these movies, but I already own How To Deal, not Raise Your Voice. Unfortunately, the movie I cared about, I can't watch because it skips. How To Deal seems to work fine. The disc isn't even all scratched up, there's maybe only one big scratch on it which I guess is why it won't work. 🫤"

This is a sad true story which was written, and done extraordinarily well, the action, and special effects are amazing.  It is a must see movie, and a great one for a get together chill night with good friends, and great food!  Hey! Just don't forget the tasty wine😄!  Enjoy🎬🎥!"

"So everyone in my life knows I am a huge DCEU and MCU fanatic. I love the Justice League and the Avengers. I enjoyed all of the movies from both franchises.<br /><br />Since this movie wraps up the first ten or eleven years of the MCU, there was plenty of wrapping up to do, and for the most part, I think it did well.<br /><br />I LIKED not loved ENDGAME. I think this was a HUGE step up from CAPTAIN MARVEL. I hated every bit of that movie, so it was amazing to have this movie cleanse my mind from that tragedy.<br /><br />I loved MOST of the fight scenes, but that final battle was pretty awesome. I loved the female team up. I think some of the CGI could've been better in most places.<br /><br />I hate time traveling and I can't tell you why exactly. There's something about it that I just can't put my finger on it but I just don't care about it. I hate in THE FLASH TV show, I hate it in any movies, I hate it in books. I think it’s just because MOST OF THE TIME there’s always that one person who doesn’t get the grasp of if you change one thing you can mess up the whole timeline. I got mad and confused too when they got the Infinity Stones through time I just feel like it didn’t mess up the previous MCU movies and I got a little bit mad.<br /><br />The comedy was good, the acting was great, yadadadadada.<br /><br />The runtime for this movie was ridiculous, but of course it had to wrap up a lot of the MCU events.<br /><br />I couldn’t get use to Bruce Hulk Hybrid. I got tired of Thor’s angst to himself. I didn’t like the ending. I just feel like there could’ve been talked about.<br /><br />I hated that Tony died but I understand why he had to but still. And now with everything about Spider Man leaving the MCU I think he’s gonna have to come back. Honestly I’d rather have him than Captain Marvel.<br /><br />I hate Falcon solely because I hate Anthony Mackie so him becoming Captain America to me is a 👎🏻.<br /><br />I use to hate the fact that Black Widow died but now with everything that Scarlett Johansson is saying and doing, I’m just like eh with it.<br /><br />I don’t mean to sound like I’m hating on ENDGAME and I don’t mean to but I’m being honest about what I think about it.<br /><br />If I had to state my Top 3 Favorite MCU Films it would be:<br />BLACK PANTHER.<br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER.<br />AVENGERS 2012.<br /><br />Least Favorite:<br />CAPTAIN MARVEL.<br />AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR.<br />THOR DARK WORLD.<br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR.<br />IRON MAN 2.<br />AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON.<br />GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.<br />GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2.<br />DR.

One of my all time favorites simply because of the truth and heart of it! The actors were spot on in their roles and I was happy to see the true Miss Chenery (might be spelled wrong) in a cameo roll in the film! She refused to give up when most everyone thought she was wrong!👍👍👍

"This is one of the funniest movies I’ve ever seen. And to know that I’ve been missing over 40 minutes of the movie!!! I’m blown away!!<br />FOR ANYONE WHO DOESNT KNOW, THIS MOVIE ISNT 1 hour 39 minutes, ITS 2!!!! 😭 I’ve never been so happy!"

"The only thing I disliked was that I had to download an update to watch. I was using a PS3 dinosaur and I’m not very tech savvy so it took a while. Otherwise, loved the movies. Lots of discs showing behind scenes, laugh reels, etc.  This is the first movie, in my mind, where the sequel is better than the prequel. I hope there’s a threequel. 😉"

"The concept was very funny but the language was offensive and unnecessary. Very disappointed in the movie but the CD  itself was in good condition. Unfortunately, we stopped the movie about a quarter of the way through it and threw the CD away. 😕"
Very hilarious comedy. These guys never let you down! 🤣😅😂😃
Them lucky bucks got to smoke with an alien and that's really cool... 💌❣️
"Adam Driver only appears in one brief scene. I watched this because I'm a big fan and I was on a mission to see all his films. 😁 This movie is well worth the watch, even with such a scanty Driver appearance. 🤣 It is excellently acted and very thought provoking. Will make you want to fill out a living will! Definitely not a feel good movie, but I don't think anyone would be expecting that. There are comedic moments in this movie, however, mostly due to the humanizing portrayal of Dr. Kevorkian's (sometimes eccentric) personality and relationships."

I found this Movie to be Soo in your Face when it comes to how Life really is! If you don't want to see how people can be to one another than this is not the movie 🎥 for you. And unfor- tunately no matter how much you Love ❤️ someone doesn't mean... Well you'd have to watch the the movie 🎥 to see all twists and turns of the Lives so on.

"I purchased this monsters in dvd combo pack for my boys a few mo the ago. It is brand new & in excellent condition.  I love the fact that it’s a blue ray set. You play it in the USA blue ray player & the quality of the dvd movies are clear & no interruptions. Monsters inc & university arrived on time & also packaged really well. It has no scratches which is always a plus & the bonus of it all is that both my boys love the movie combo. It has lots of vibrant colors of all sorts of different kind of monsters. They are all so adorable & not scary at all. Which is great for toddlers. In my opinion, it’s the last thing I would want are my boys freaking out & getting nightmares over a movie.<br />So with that being said, I would rate the Monsters inc & University a 5🌟 outta 5🌟. It is great for both adults & kiddos & for the kid at heart. I highly recommend it for families"

"Oh my gosh where do I begin? Fave movie ever, ummmm star sTUDDED cast (Streep😩, Hathaway ❤️, Blunt👏🏼, Tucci✨), fanTAStic plot, amazing script-work, what’s not to like? I can talk for literally the rest of my life about just how much I would love to be personally screamed at by Miss Priestly (aka the Devil) herself or give to be Andy Sachs (she does have a job millions of girls would KILL for, after all). This movie drips with humor and comic drama and honestly I love it soooooooooooooooo very much. This film and its cast bring me joy whenever I watch and I am so psyched to have it as a digital copy now so I literally never have to go anywhere without the comfort of knowing I have this A+++++++++ classic in my very own pOCKET! To sum, gr8 movie, love everyone, thank you so much, and that’s all! ❤️✨🤗"

"Ok, so I just picked this movie up from Best Buy for my Friday night entertainment with a few Stouffer's French Bread pizzas! 🍕🤗🍧🎮📺 ... So I REALLY wanted to enjoy this! Now I DID HEAR that the movie was ""bad"", but there was nothing else I really wanted to see, I'm not joining expensive HBO Max and I wanted to see it for myself. Well, they didn't lie - yeah, it's pretty bad! 😔👎 .... Not HORRIBLE mind you, but bad. What makes it seem worse than it really is - is because the first Wonder Woman-(WW) movie was SO FRIGGIN AWESOME!!! She was also a TOTAL BAD-A$$ in ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"". I mean, she's a REALLY REALLY GREAT CHARACTER - A true & worthy counterpart to Superman! So to see her in something of THIS low caliber is just sad & unnecessary.<br /><br />STORY LINE<br /><br />THE BAD...<br />The story in this was so lame & convoluted and made such HUGE leaps in continuity... that it seemed as though great chunks of story & explanation were left on the editing room floor. It seemed like they were SO FOCUSED on promoting & boosting ALL THINGS WOMEN & FEMALE, that the writers totally forgot to put a ""GOOD MOVIE"" in there somewhere. How could this happen? How was the story & implementation of WW1 so great, and the story & implementation of WW2 such a WRECK???<br /><br />Well, I looked at the writers for WW1 and ... BINGO - PROBLEM FOUND!!  .... ALL THE WRITERS FOR WW1 - WERE MEN!!! So it ended up as being an ((AGENDA-FREE)) - GUTS & GLORY EXPLOSION OF AWESOMENESS!!! The writers were - Allan Heinberg, Jason Fuchs, and of course ya boy (ZACK SNYDER) - The man who single handedly remade a flopped - JUSTICE LEAGUE... into a CINEMATIC EXTRAVAGANZA THAT WAS EVEN  BETTER than ""AVENGERS ENDGAME"" - simply by giving the FANS what they wanted WITH NO FEMAGENDA ATTACHED!! 😍<br /><br />Well for SOME HELLISH REASON, they decided to change the writers for WW1 - (Patty Jenkins &<br />Geoff Johns). There were also 3 male & 1 female ""PRODUCERS for WW1 - (Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Richard Suckle).<br />But for WW2 I guess they wanted to ""balance it out"" and added 2 more women. WW2 Producers = (Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Patty Jenkins, Gal Gadot, Stephen Jones).... 6 PRODUCERS for ONE movie, and HALF of them women??? ... YUP! A recipe for 2 HOURS OF PURE FEMINIST 🐂 💩!!<br /><br />As a result, this whole movie is basically just a lame & boring ""LOVE STORY"" with a lot of special effects, and the FEMAGENDA IS ON FULL NUCLEAR BLAST!!!! 🙄 Within MINUTES of the movie starting, we see all of the men BLATANTLY portrayed as grubby, evil, selfish, demented perverts & r@pists. Yeah, that's 15-20 minutes into the show. By the END of the movie, a man is  all hell bent on destroying the world, while ONLY WONDER WOMAN tries to save it lol.  I mean SERIOUSLY - THIS WAS THE WHOLE MOVIE IN 3 SENTENCES!!<br /><br />They even gave their view on black men as well. There were only a handful of blacks in the whole city to begin with - all of which fit all of the stereotypes! LOL.. But one in particular stood out and was focused on. There was an old black man bum who was sleeping on a park bench, and it was only a white WOMAN who took pity on him and gave him food! LOL... WTF?!?! 😂😂😂 These twisted people tell on themselves without even trying! The black guy got off easy though, because all the other evil-labels listed above were applied to white men! lol... It was clear that to the female writers & producers of this movie... the problem is... ""MEN""!! LOLOL.. 😂<br /><br />It's actually good to watch this movie (if you can see it for free) - for 2 reasons. 1). To see how NOT to make a movie. 2). To see HOW HARD THE FEMAGENDA IS ATTACKING MEN!! (Know thy enemy).<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS - (SPOILER ALERT)<br />- (Don't continue reading if you don't want to ruin the big wonderful surprises! 🙄 lol)<br /><br />The effects in this movie were weird and inconsistent. One minute WW is sliding across floors and whipping her magic lasso around - just to stop MEN from robbing banks, taking children hostage and threatening to throw little girls off balconies. WW doesn't want people to know she's helping people, so to keep a low profile, she runs around in a skimpy star-spangled bikini and beats up all the bad men. smh... Yep, that all happened! It was weird, because as she jumped and twirled all through the mall beating up men... she still had time to stop and say hi to all the cute & innocent little girls lol.<br /><br />The weird part though was how she just floated around on her jumps LOL... She wasn't supposed to be able to fly, but her jumps were so poorly done that she just ""floated"" around. In this modern era of SUPER SPECIAL EFFECTS, there is NO EXCUSE for bad stunts & SFX. Her SFX in WW1 were MUCH MUCH BETTER!! No ""floating"" - her jumps were JUMPS - PERIOD! You could almost picture her dangling off a crane in this one though lol. It really was 1984 level effects, and her LASSO.. OMG!! 😵<br /><br />Her lasso was actually THE STAR OF THE SHOW, and WW was just how the lasso got around to the crime locations. She used that lasso for EVERYTHINGGGGG.. LOL.. I'm surprised she wasn't lassoing her food into her mouth! lol. She even lasso'd a friggin BULLET at one point! LMAOoooo... 😂😂😂.. I 💩 you not!!<br /><br />She lasso'd a commercial airliner and hitched a ride, and even lightning and swung like Tarzan on the lightning bolts! smh.. Yeah.. that's how bad & cheesy it got. She got her ""Invisible Jet"" in this one... Guess how she got the jet.. She stole it, and just ""WILLED IT"" to become invisible! LOL.. 😂 Boom - it disappeared from the sky and off radar! (I guess it didn't have transponders in it, and I'm sure she'll find a qualified pilot & mechanic from somewhere. I guess she's rich too and can keep it fueled up and ready to go at a moments notice lol.  She learned to FLY in this one (which should eliminate the need for a jet! LOL.. I don't even remember what happened to the jet or if she still has it. It was hard to stay focused on this movie or even care what happened).<br /><br />Now here's the weird part... When she started flying on her own - THAT ACTUALLY LOOKED FANTASTIC!!! That part had to be one the the MEN's FEW contributions, and is the ONLY reason I gave it TWO stars instead of ONE. Her flying looked VERY realistic (except for her hair lol)...  She was up in the clouds, doing loops and freefalls, but her loose hanging HAIR didn't reflect the changes in her momentum & direction. Movie watchers today are far too intelligent & sophisticated not to catch MAJOR slip-ups like that.<br />Some people can even tell you that a PEN or COFFEE CUP is out of place in a scene. I'm not THAT good, but HAIR & CLOTHES that don't react to MASSIVE AIR FLOW is blatant, and something I'd expect & accept in ""Sharknado 12"", not a big budget ""Wonder Woman"" movie!!<br /><br />IN SUMMARY<br />Basically, let's just be honest - WOMEN AND THEIR AGENDA DESTROYED THIS MOVIE!!! Yeah I know (ALL THOSE HORRIBLE MEN) were involved in making it too, but THE MEN decked out the FIRST movie, so it stands to reason that all those extra women they added were the ones who RUINED this one. It seems the men were allowed very little control over the movie this time around - AND IT SHOWS!!<br /><br />I might even suggest jotting down the names of EVERY WOMAN associated with this movie and put them on a WATCH LIST!! Then check their FUTURE & PAST movies for cross-reference to ferret out the FEMINAZI'S!!<br />Any woman who appears in multiple FEMAGENDA productions - BE SURE to never watch or support ANYTHING they are associated with. We have to start IDENTIFYING & CALLING OUT ALL FEMAGENDA MOVIES & TV SHOWS, so that (AS DIRTY FILTHY DISGUSTING MEN)... we can AVOID giving OUR dirty filthy MONEY to THEIR agenda. Eventually - the industry will get the message, like Amber Heard got it! Like Brie Larson got it! Like the Batwoman series got it! Like the Supergirl series got it and is FINALLYYYY on their last season! Yaaayyy!!  🎉🎈🎂👏🏽😄 lol...<br /><br />Let's keep the momentum going, and not give a DIME of our hard earned DIRTY MAN-MONEY to support THEIR crusade against us; and you can START by avoiding putting any money into this garbage-fest of a movie here! Eventually Hollywood will get SICK of all their Femagenda movies flopping and losing MILLIONS, and then they (theoretically) should be forced to going back to making GOOD MOVIES for FUN & ENTERTAINMENT... not to push PSYCHO-SOCIO-POLITICAL AGENDAS! 👊🏾😎"
"Ok, so I just picked this movie up from Best Buy for my Friday night entertainment with a few Stouffer's French Bread pizzas! 🍕🤗🍧🎮📺 ... So I REALLY wanted to enjoy this! Now I DID HEAR that the movie was ""bad"", but there was nothing else I really wanted to see, I'm not joining expensive HBO Max and I wanted to see it for myself. Well, they didn't lie - yeah, it's pretty bad! 😔👎 .... Not HORRIBLE mind you, but bad. What makes it seem worse than it really is - is because the first Wonder Woman-(WW) movie was SO FRIGGIN AWESOME!!! She was also a TOTAL BAD-A$$ in ""Zack Snyder's Justice League"". I mean, she's a REALLY REALLY GREAT CHARACTER - A true & worthy counterpart to Superman! So to see her in something of THIS low caliber is just sad & unnecessary.<br /><br />STORY LINE<br /><br />THE BAD...<br />The story in this was so lame & convoluted and made such HUGE leaps in continuity... that it seemed as though great chunks of story & explanation were left on the editing room floor. It seemed like they were SO FOCUSED on promoting & boosting ALL THINGS WOMEN & FEMALE, that the writers totally forgot to put a ""GOOD MOVIE"" in there somewhere. How could this happen? How was the story & implementation of WW1 so great, and the story & implementation of WW2 such a WRECK???<br /><br />Well, I looked at the writers for WW1 and ... BINGO - PROBLEM FOUND!!  .... ALL THE WRITERS FOR WW1 - WERE MEN!!! So it ended up as being an ((AGENDA-FREE)) - GUTS & GLORY EXPLOSION OF AWESOMENESS!!! The writers were - Allan Heinberg, Jason Fuchs, and of course ya boy (ZACK SNYDER) - The man who single handedly remade a flopped - JUSTICE LEAGUE... into a CINEMATIC EXTRAVAGANZA THAT WAS EVEN  BETTER than ""AVENGERS ENDGAME"" - simply by giving the FANS what they wanted WITH NO FEMAGENDA ATTACHED!! 😍<br /><br />Well for SOME HELLISH REASON, they decided to change the writers for WW1 - (Patty Jenkins &<br />Geoff Johns). There were also 3 male & 1 female ""PRODUCERS for WW1 - (Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Richard Suckle).<br />But for WW2 I guess they wanted to ""balance it out"" and added 2 more women. WW2 Producers = (Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, Zack Snyder, Patty Jenkins, Gal Gadot, Stephen Jones).... 6 PRODUCERS for ONE movie, and HALF of them women??? ... YUP! A recipe for 2 HOURS OF PURE FEMINIST 🐂 💩!!<br /><br />As a result, this whole movie is basically just a lame & boring ""LOVE STORY"" with a lot of special effects, and the FEMAGENDA IS ON FULL NUCLEAR BLAST!!!! 🙄 Within MINUTES of the movie starting, we see all of the men BLATANTLY portrayed as grubby, evil, selfish, demented perverts & r@pists. Yeah, that's 15-20 minutes into the show. By the END of the movie, a man is  all hell bent on destroying the world, while ONLY WONDER WOMAN tries to save it lol.  I mean SERIOUSLY - THIS WAS THE WHOLE MOVIE IN 3 SENTENCES!!<br /><br />They even gave their view on black men as well. There were only a handful of blacks in the whole city to begin with - all of which fit all of the stereotypes! LOL.. But one in particular stood out and was focused on. There was an old black man bum who was sleeping on a park bench, and it was only a white WOMAN who took pity on him and gave him food! LOL... WTF?!?! 😂😂😂 These twisted people tell on themselves without even trying! The black guy got off easy though, because all the other evil-labels listed above were applied to white men! lol... It was clear that to the female writers & producers of this movie... the problem is... ""MEN""!! LOLOL.. 😂<br /><br />It's actually good to watch this movie (if you can see it for free) - for 2 reasons. 1). To see how NOT to make a movie. 2). To see HOW HARD THE FEMAGENDA IS ATTACKING MEN!! (Know thy enemy).<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS - (SPOILER ALERT)<br />- (Don't continue reading if you don't want to ruin the big wonderful surprises! 🙄 lol)<br /><br />The effects in this movie were weird and inconsistent. One minute WW is sliding across floors and whipping her magic lasso around - just to stop MEN from robbing banks, taking children hostage and threatening to throw little girls off balconies. WW doesn't want people to know she's helping people, so to keep a low profile, she runs around in a skimpy star-spangled bikini and beats up all the bad men. smh... Yep, that all happened! It was weird, because as she jumped and twirled all through the mall beating up men... she still had time to stop and say hi to all the cute & innocent little girls lol.<br /><br />The weird part though was how she just floated around on her jumps LOL... She wasn't supposed to be able to fly, but her jumps were so poorly done that she just ""floated"" around. In this modern era of SUPER SPECIAL EFFECTS, there is NO EXCUSE for bad stunts & SFX. Her SFX in WW1 were MUCH MUCH BETTER!! No ""floating"" - her jumps were JUMPS - PERIOD! You could almost picture her dangling off a crane in this one though lol. It really was 1984 level effects, and her LASSO.. OMG!! 😵<br /><br />Her lasso was actually THE STAR OF THE SHOW, and WW was just how the lasso got around to the crime locations. She used that lasso for EVERYTHINGGGGG.. LOL.. I'm surprised she wasn't lassoing her food into her mouth! lol. She even lasso'd a friggin BULLET at one point! LMAOoooo... 😂😂😂.. I 💩 you not!!<br /><br />She lasso'd a commercial airliner and hitched a ride, and even lightning and swung like Tarzan on the lightning bolts! smh.. Yeah.. that's how bad & cheesy it got. She got her ""Invisible Jet"" in this one... Guess how she got the jet.. She stole it, and just ""WILLED IT"" to become invisible! LOL.. 😂 Boom - it disappeared from the sky and off radar! (I guess it didn't have transponders in it, and I'm sure she'll find a qualified pilot & mechanic from somewhere.

"The dvd only contained the first Eddie and the Cruisers movie. It was packaged as both 1 and 2. The movie otherwise was good visually but sound was not the best. Have to play it at full volume to hear the actors speaking, then the music is quite loud....but it was from the 80s so not surprised. But the product was not as stated. Still do not I have the second and I found have gotten the first movie cheaper. Very disappointed 😑"

Sadly, when an updated film version of the show was made it picked “stars” instead of singers. J.Depp and H.B. Carter are just poor imitations. I rate THIS original version 5+ stars<br />🎵🎶"

But, yeah, terrible service and quality of the product upon arrival. With that being said, I consider Black & Chrome Edition superior to the regular and I'm very excited to own it on blu-ray. I only hope it works without issues 🤞"

"This is a plea to the dvd gods for a NEW Blu Ray edition of this great film.  The colors!  The acting!  The dancing!, The costumes! The screenplay! The MUSIC!  Many songs, especially William Warfield singing Old Man River, will give you the shivering goosebumps as you fumble for tissues.  The happy enslaved people popping up from picking cotton is hard to watch, but the rest of the story’s history and message about the evils of slavery, racism & dehumanization are inspirational.  As a girl, Showboat spoke to me about this & black peoples pain, & is one reason it always still makes me cry.  Marge & Gower Champion are a delight to watch dance, and Ava Gardner will break your heart.  💯💯💯💯💯💯"

A little bit of a slow starting movie this fact made worse by 9.5 minutes of credits at the start of it ~but all in all Oliver stone knocked another one out of the park! A rare crystal clear Blu-ray Tm disc picture/clarity clocks in at a consistent low 30’s MBPS !🎥🍿👀🎞

"LOVE Mickey Gilley (our next door neighbor was his older brother, so got to visit with him when he'd come into town for a day or two). But this movie left me sorely disappointed. Expected better than what it turned out to be. Tore up the DVD and into the trash can it went. Stupid and trashy from beginning to end! Doesn't even deserve one star but can't submit my review wirhout one, so...😞"

"I purchased season 1 from Circuit City YEARS AGO! The prices for the remaining seasons were ridiculous, so when I finally saw that the complete season of Soul Food was available during a ""lightning deal,"" I had to purchase it!! So glad I did, so now I have seasons 2-4 to add to the Season 1 I already had!! I must admit, I would love for Tracey Edmonds to do a reboot/revival of Soul Food💖"
"This set has been every single episode, and it arrived in 2 days! 👍🏽👍🏽"
Great value for the complete series and arrived faster than expected 👍
"These 4 movie titles are a must for our collection of videos because we love 💘 Mel and Danny G. and because these videos are a must have for holiday season viewing.  They're a great combination of our two favorite genres, action and comedy.  And these two guys have what it takes to pull it off!  Never a dull moment in these edge of your seat thrill rides. Good for viewing in a group or at home with hubby .  Comes highly recommended from all here!"

Me and my husband seen this in the theater we laughed so hard we was crying. Definitely not a kids movie. Foul language and sexual endos. Loved it. Best comedy I've seen in years. They need to do a part two. Thanks for making this movie. Can't wait for daughters in their 20's to watch this too. 👍🏻

"First off, my comments do not apply to this particular Solo blu ray disc.<br />My comments are relevant to the Multi-Screen Edition blu ray (photo included) I received as a gift from a good friend(who knows nothing much about Star Wars movies since she’s into Anime only 🙂)<br />The blu ray disc was received with a sealed plastic wrapping and when I played disc, the first image I saw was “This disc has been previously reviewed. Do you want to continue?”  Out of curiosity, I selected “Yes” and the end credits appeared.  This viewing lead me to believe that disc was not new, but rather a burned, 2nd or older generation copy.<br />Secondly, the images look darker than what I recall from watching the movie in the theaters.  Also, the same movie on Disney+ is brighter and includes deleted scenes.  The disc I received does not include any bonus or special features. Supposedly, bonus features are included with the digital version when using digital code.  As it turns out, the digital version seems a bit brighter than the actual blu ray copy I received.<br />It appears to me that this disc is not a new or original disc that I received. Unfortunately, I don’t recall if Amazon sold disc, but Amazon shipped disc, that’s for certain.<br />I decided to keep the disc rather than to discard  or return it since I wanted to add movie to my Star Wars movies collection<br />Of course, I’ll be more mindful in the future of who sells and ships blu ray movies, which I usually do not buy online.<br />One last note, the same blu ray disc I received is sold by Target<br />So, buyers beware"

I can’t believe I could not find this in any store. Bless Amazon for this because our little man is obsessed with minions and Netflix only has the third one. We were going insane watching Evil Bratt every time. 😂

REALLY⁉️⁉️ Where do they even GET this kind of garbage⁉️⁉️⁉️ This is so BAD‼️ Music is annoying…it’s boring…SLOW…hard to see (get your night vision glasses out for some of it!)…What was the point?? I don’t even GET it 🤔🤔 The ONLY reason I watched it all the way through is because Amazon suggested it after I watched Sixth Sense. I LOVED that so I thought this would be good. ZERO comparison!!

My 11 y/o grandaughter watched the movie and completed a wonderful classroom presentation about the women in this story during BLACK HISTORY MONTH👌👌❗😊<br />This was a great movie to watch during pandemic.  We did suffer some playback issues but my husband finally work things out after discussing problems with an IT problem solver.<br />We finally ended up watching the movie on our laptop computer.

"I honestly don't see how anyone who is a fan of the original anime can begin to defend this heaping pile. I'm all for changing a story to make something original, but this movie just did it so poorly.<br /><br />From Motoko's new origin story (*SPOILER* to explain the whitewashing, she WAS japanese, but was kidnapped and turned into a white woman 😂), to the attempt at adapting the puppet master but now he's actually a victim good guy who was buddies with Motoko in her japanese life? The flow of the story is all over the place. The biggest travesty though, was how they completely overlooked the conversation with Motoko and Batou in the fishing boat. In the anime, they had a deep talk about humanity, and if having cybernetic implants makes you less of a human, or takes away humanity altogether. The movie missed all the marks that made the anime great, and ScarJo's horrendous acting certainly didn't help the situation.<br /><br />Seriously, if you enjoyed the anime, just flat-out avoid this movie. Not even the action scenes could save it from itself."

"Let's get down to the nitty gritty on this.....it was being bashed on Tumblr and various other online critic pages before it came out....with points ranging from somewhat valid to the downright petty........all of which I found falling to the wayside upon seeing this movie......it was surprisingly good, and not only (in my humble opinion, mind you..) was it love letter to the Animated movie it was based on, it came into it's own, and even asked, and answered, some questions of its own..........yes, it did have a fairly generic plot woven in (corporate conspiracy), but the execution not only made it approachable to a larger audience, but also made the characters more relatable.......top marks 😊"

"So this film actually introduced to me the Resident Evil fandom and after that I had been gifted The Umbrella Chronicles for my Wii and I loved thar game so much. It was nice watching something that introduced me to Resident Evil and I liked I said with Vendetta, I like these CGI films - if they want to bring Resident Evil into a film form I think its better just sticking with the CGI films because live action won't satisfy everyone and I know this because I'm not a fan of the Milla Jovovich Resident Evil films and the recent and upcoming Resident Evil<br />live action films/shows that'll be made. Not only that but these CGI films remind me so much of the games of course which I do like that while seeing the characters we love on screen. I will say I forgot how Leon's face looked in this one and I LOVE Leon but I think he looks better in Vendetta than here but that's just how he looks 😅 I do like this story too - the idea of a bunch of zombies in an airport that thought terrifies me but I liked the storyline and I was so happy seeing Claire 😊 I'd reccomend this movie ❤"

"If I could give this movie zero stars, I would.  I absolutely despise this movie.  I watched this movie with my Mom.  Neither one of us knew anything about it going in other than it looked like a nice, family rom-com that the ads had been showing.  My Mom was about 4-6 weeks into her breast cancer returning.  That is why I despise this movie.  Beyond that, the plot of guy brings home fiancé, leaves her at home with his brother to hunt his college sweetheart, and then they both find the love of their lives that way, is unbelievable.  Add in a breast cancer plot for mom that feels shoehorned in where she’s dead by next Christmas and this movie is barely a two star movie.  I subtract two stars for my situation, but Amazon forces at least a minimum of one star.👎"

This is not a review of the movie Fight Club but a review of the DVD that I purchased. I have gone all these years having never seen this movie. A few have told me that I’m crazy and it’s an amazing movie and I will be mad that I never watched it sooner. This made me anxious to watch it and finally ordered this one after not finding a physical copy in stores. I tried to watch it the night that it arrived. I did see “some” similar reviews but I would expect to see more unless I’m just part of the unlucky few and some people get good copies. The one I got was packaged and “sealed” with a new looming disc but when playing it this thing is bootleg quality. First off the sound quality was one of the worst I’ve ever encountered. I typically have my volume at 10 when watching something but this required 30+ but still has a muffled quality. Then of course at some points in the movie it would become suddenly insanely loud. Many areas of the movie have a loud buzzing sound overlaying the audio. It is “widescreen” but a very narrow wide screen🤔. But it’s also “cut” strangely making the movie a fairly small rectangle in the middle of the tv. It not only had black strips across the top and bottom like a widescreen but also a significant amount on each side. It’s not because it’s a movie from 1999. I have movies that old and older and some are the original dvds not remastered and the quality is great (for its time). This was so bad that I really did try but was not able to watch very much of it which sucks because I also couldn’t get into the movie or even follow it and it ruined my excitement and anticipation to see it for the first time. I was excited to really like this movie and me mad at myself that I never watched it sooner.  So it is genuinely my opinion that this could very well have been a bootleg copy and I returned it.

My favorite movie of all time. I watch it all the time at least 2-3 times a month. I have been watching it since I was probably 3-4. I remember asking my mom about why she ever brought it home for me and she said thought I would like it and that didn't realize it would be come a life long obsession of mine lol I had the vhs tape watched it so much the sounds and the color would go in and out lol one of the best movies ever. I hope everyone gets a chance to watch it at least once. Also whenever new people come over to my house and they have not watched it I always make them watch it with me 😂🤣😂😂😂

"Both movies are great action packed. Got to see the first one on Netflix but they didn't have the second one. So that's why I bought this, so I could have both movies without having to depend on the network or the WI-FI. Zorro was well done by Antonio Banderas!! It was here within 48 hours from the time I ordered it! 😊"

This is the most HYSTERICAL MOVIE I’ve seen in decades for adults.  I saw it as soon as it came out opening weekend and have been DYING to get a Blu-ray copy to watch it at LEAST five more times!<br />I had to go to the restroom during the movie and REFUSED to miss a second!<br />Jeremy and Ed MADE this movie a COMEDY CLASSIC in my opinion!<br />I cannot even begin to tell anyone HOW HYSTERICAL this movie is!  My absolute NEW FAV 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣

"Five stars for Nicholas Hoult (LOVE him!) Four stars for the movie, great bad guys, lots of intense action, and good one-liners. But one star for the lead girl who was in Rogue One (the only Star Wars movie I hate). She’s unbearable to watch 🤮"

My family watched the peanuts movie and I have to say that Charlie Brown and the gang are the most lovable children and I especially love snoopy and Woodstock. This movie was really good about charlie falling in love with the girl next door. What was so clever was how she got to know charlie which you will see in the movie.<br /><br />What I love about this movie is that these kids are funny and Charlie teaches the world that life is about taking chances and that life is too short to be sad and depressed. To be happy and learn that there isn't any wrong with being misunderstood . Sometimes being misunderstood is the reason why the girl next door loved Charlie.<br /><br />I hope that they make another peanuts movies . it was really great movie with laughs and smiles and with an important message that tells us a few things like<br /><br />Mans best friend will always be by ur side<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with being misunderstood.<br /><br />The most important lesson of all is don't be nervous when ringing the girl nexts door house you never know what the reaction will be.  😉<br /><br />A++++++ this is a must buy for a penny 👍

"My girls were so excited to receive the movie, they tore it open upon arrival. Unfortunately (and maybe the comments during purchase noted this; I don’t recall), there was a sticker stating something like “may not work in all regions.” Well, that’s great 🙄 North American DVD players apparently don’t qualify. Junk. We’re disappointed."

As good of a movie as heroes journey ~ would have given it 4 stars if not for yet another Blu-ray Tm disc picture clarity rated at about 1/2 the quality of some frequently dipping as low as 15 MBPS. 35= top quality. Also case arrived damaged-USPS = LAME 🐌

"One of my favorite all time films. Rich colors, frank non PC script and plenty of stylish swag. The dance club scene and aftermath is classic cinema. It is said that Stanley Kubrick himself was impressed by this film so what better endorsement can you get. 🎬"

The sticker on the box says it all. The full 26 episodes Series of Neon Genesis Evangelion. There's no director's cut episodes though 😩. Included in the platinum box version.

"Why did Shout! Factory crop the print?!?! The movie is five stars. It looks great, sounds great, the extras are fun! But.... It's been formatted to widescreen but the original was not, so much of the top and bottom of the film is cropped off. This is unacceptable! Yeah, I'm keeping it for the great print, but glad I still have my cheap DVD that is full frame. So disappointed 😞 and saddened by what should have been excellent."

"What isn't there to love in this movie, you have Jennifer Conally and there is the Goblin King himself David Bowie, oh lordy as a child he rocked my world but back then I thought it meant someone who you adore and put on a pedestal that is high in your books, so I will leave it at that, but if that man was available back then I would of put myself in Alot of training just to marry the Goblin King himself. Haha yeah only in my dreams 🤣😂 anyways I wonder what Mr Hensen was dreaming or thinking when he made this movie. It's ashamed that David Bowie is no longer around for a second time around as the Goblin King no one absolutely no one can play the Goblin King other than Bowie. R.I.P DAVID AND JIM UR BOTH FREAKEN AMAZING<br /><br />U REMIND ME OF A BABE THE POWER OF THE BABE WHO DO U DO I SAW MY BABY TRYING AS HARD AS BABE COULD TRY"

My grandfather likes watching the little cilps on YouTube. So I bought whole movie for him. so he can watch the whole movie in one. If it makes my grandfather watch it over and over again on YouTube short cilps it's got to be good 👍

"This is supposed to be a teenage version of the musical Cabaret. Patrick Dempsey plays a serious writer and Helen Slater plays his polar opposite : a Carefree extroverted drama student who lives life to the fullest. They are like oil and water together and it's such fun to watch 😉 If you're a fan of Cabaret, then this film is a must-see 🎥"

This movie has a few rough areas but it's basically a pretty good family movie starring Kenny Rodgers as a has been car racer who with the help of 6 kids (who can quickly take apart a car and fix one up just as fast) put him back into the racing circuit and also to eventually become a family man. I saw this one years ago and have been wanting to buy it ever since. 😊

"This is by far my favorite christmas movie ever, even though a short part of this classic is set at Christmas time. This movie is a bit on the slow side, quite a bit of talking, but there is plenty of heart warming scenes, strength of family bonding , Siblings being there for each other. This movie just has old time goodness in it , much like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET. Simple holiday movies we keep in our hearts always. Thanks for reading, BYE.😊"

"This movie is completely underrated it baffles me. I was 6 years old when this movie came out and never saw until just recently and can I say I'm stunned by how poorly this movie did. This has already made into my top 10 favorite Disney films and probably overall just one of favorites.  It's a beautiful film with so much heart and adventure. It's definetely not a &#34;typical&#34; disney film, but just love it anyways.  If you haven't seen it, watch it on Netflix! Then buy the film, you won't regret it! 😬"

This is the original how the Grinch stole Christmas and it is still the best one. the live action Jim Carrey movie is really good but that other new Grinch cartoon that came out a few years ago is straight garbage! They tried to make the Grinch very fuzzy and cute in that one and that was a mistake. The Grinch is supposed to be ugly dirty looking and mean. But I digress.. this is the original one with Boris Karloff narrating the story and this is a holiday must watch must own classic! it is good to have your own copy of this because you are going to want to look at it at least three times every holiday season.. I do. 😆👍🏽

"This DVD 📀 that I ordered was actually to replace the original copy I had several years back. I kinda wish that they (Rob Zombie) had of decided to have gone with the alternate kill seen with the sexy little nude dancer. But I am assuming it was not just gore and shock value, but so it would be reminiscent of the 140* hot tub scene from the John Carpenter’s 1981 original which was a good deal taken/happening in a hospital 🏥. Nurse Karen was her character’s name. Even though a somewhat graphic scene, at least she was in a state of total shock once pulled out of the boiling water the 3rd time. Pamela Susan Shoop [Nurse Karen] in my opinion was the  hottest (no pun intended) actress in the movie 🎥 as well! And the brunette that went to the Halloween party dressed as Tim Curry’s character in‘The Rocky Horror Picture Show’ was a pretty scantily, turn on too. I have to admit, except for Halloween 🎃 1&2, oh yeah, and ‘A House Of 1,000 corpses’ which was a little bit much. I have not been able to get into (through) Mr. Zombie’s films. Nothing against him! I really liked‘White Zombie’  🎸🎤🎶🎼…and from listening to commentary-to behind the scenes instructions to the cast members, he seems well spoken, professional and discreet. This DVD arrived in my mailbox 📬 at least a couple weeks earlier than predicted, and in excellent shape if it has been brand new. I got it for a few bucks. I’m very satisfied. Thank You, Jason"

Completely!😉<br />What they did to the movie is they took the original and made the parts with high definition graphics and it made it super pool!<br />Oh, if you had seen the older one, buy this, won't regret it."

Lucky I taught of purchasing but after reading the review the Punisher Extended Cut is not actually Extended Edition instead Theatrical Ver will not buying it unless confirmed if it is Uncut Ver😅😅😅

"I feel that there’s some things I need to get out of the way and get off my chest.  If you’re looking for a movie that is along the lines of high-speed, fake, phony, Avengers style, or a garden-variety Hollywood puke diving trash that has that BOOM BOOM BOOM TEMPO, fast, driving, fast driven, things reaching out grabbing somebody by their fins and yanking them down into the deep, this movie is not for you.<br /><br />You’re going to be bored to death so pass it on by.  I’ve already seen comments out of people that that had no business watching this movie. And if they would’ve googled what this movie is about they would’ve never watched it.  They watched it to be,  “entertained!!”.  this movie is not an entertainment movie,  per se.<br /><br />  It is not a biography, per se.  Suffice to say,  it’s a movie about a tragic diving accident.  Made by diver for,  divers.  I won’t waste anyone’s time. Hence, waste there $$$$$$ money.  It’s a heart-felt movie.  No,  it does not move fast.  None whatsoever.  It’s not made by high level Hollywood professional people.  So it’s not a polished up buff of a film. Nor is it a polished up documentary.<br /><br />It is,  a very very down to earth story of men that are extremely well known “inside our diving community”,  world  🌎 wide.  🌍  It’s a tragic story.  A sad story. And I don’t think that there’s a deep water diver out there that doesn’t wish that they had been there to take part in this. To be a-part of this.<br /><br /> I know I’m no different than other divers that has said at times if I would’ve been there this would not have happened.  And yet,  that’s bravado talking,  briefly.  Ego talking.  Swiftly.  And after that passes,  I know in my heart that chances are,  my presence wouldn’t have made one-bit-of-difference.<br /><br /> Not one-bit-of difference.  Because,  down in that dark cold cold pitch black water,  was 2 of the finest,  if not the finest, deep-water divers known to man-kind.  Every diver like me that has been diving deep for a number of years on wrecks are good.  We are.  We are very very good. If not,  we would not have made it as long as we have.  But with that being said,  what happened to Dave,  could happen to any,  Any of us.<br /><br />  Any of us.  And that is the tragic truth.  And I’m not the only one I know that has said what I’m about to say. And I will not be the last.  And that is this.  “THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO ME!!”  Once again,  that’s bravado,  scared  ego talking.”  So please google what is this movie about,  and,  And go watch a YOUTUBE video about it before,  you pay to rent it.  As a matter fact if you’re not a diver,  I’d recommend not watching it.  You will be bored."

My dinosaur loving child is obsessed with these movies. I grew up watching them. And by them I mean the first maybe 3... did not know there were 14. But thank God because kids like to rewatch things over and over so I'd rather watch each of them 10 times versus one or 2 of them 100 times 🥴

"I saw this movie for the first time as an adult in my early thirties. Somewhere around 10 years ago. I am one of those people who gets insanely into Halloween.  My kids had the vhs at the time and had seen it before i ever had, they wanted me to watch with them and i reluctantly agreed. Thinking it was going to be lame because it was a kids Halloween movie. My oldest son's grandparents bought it for him and he brought it home. Well we would watch it together every year after that. Then they started to get too old so i eventually bought myself the DVD and i watch it mostly by myself every year, at least 20 times starting in July. No joke. Lol. To me Hocus pocus IS Halloween!! My oldest son is 23 now. I am the same age as Max and Allison IRL 😁"

Well all I can say..is that it was not as good as some of the reviews have started..and only rated one star from me.. and the lesbian scene truly did not help at all...its one of those watch once. Movies. And then you kick yourself.. and then give it away to someone else..👎👎👎👎👎

"I saw this frist at the Pickwick drive inn in Burbank,ca when it came out. You have some of the best actors in one film and I think the best of all time my favorite bad guy Lee Marvin.<br />I love the way he's always picking on that one man(kids I'm not saying to be a bully, remember Mr Marvin was just acting in a way that in real life is not acceptable.) Also to you complaining about ""the movie is in black and white"" So what, that's the way they wanted to make it and you were not there. So really it doesn't matter what you think! Great films have be made without color, don't you remember Nebraska or<br />The Artist? Anyway this Blu-ray of one of the best Westerns ever filmed looks & sounds great 👍."

"This is a superior film about a superior human being. This film has the most intelligent dialogue at many levels. The development of complex relationships is a chess game of people who have an eye on the bigger picture. And Humanity's success is solely built upon their synergistic talents and temperaments colliding and then succumbing to their higher sense of purpose. Yes, Turing is the instegater and the genius, but he knows not how needy and how vulnerable he is as a human being. He is still grieving for Christopher after so many years, and because it was a forbidden and hidden homosexual love, he can share his deep love and loss with no one. He is a completely broken man in this respect. Yet he is more sane and intelligent than everyone around him. My friends, this is a living hell.<br /><br />Alan saved the Western hemisphere from German domination. He blurted out his homosexual affair. He was now a criminal. The world 🌎 has changed but it's still filled with the same type of unfortunate people. Mediocrity can't understand creative souls or those who are different or superior to them. So they try to crucify them one way or another. Alan Turing is a name everyone should know and honor from history."

I came across this movie by chance and am so glad that I watched it. It is about the opposite of an &#34;action movie&#34; as you can get. It is a character study of a family torn apart by dark secret. I liked it all the way to the end. It is very well cast and all characters were perfect. I am now in love with Gerard Butler and need to go see what else he's been in. 😊

"I am a really big ABBA fan.<br />I am a big musical fan.<br />Loved the original Momma Mia movie.<br /><br />This movie wins hands down.<br />Yes, I know it was released years ago, but I am always late to these parties.<br /><br />I will not give up the plot line. Not will I tell you how many times that I have watched this movie since I received it.<br /><br />ABBA fan? Like musicals? Liked the original Momma Mia?<br />This movie is for you.<br />I also highly recommend that you do some online research about the movie and it helps you see the parts that I would have not seen. Some being some bloopers.<br /><br />I know this is blasphemy, however, I am not a big Cher fan.<br /><br />Really sceptical with her it this movie.<br />I tell you brilliant casting. Cher was made for this role.<br />I also watched the extra clip with Cher being interviewed. I might have become a Cher fan.<br /><br />Yes. Even years later. But this movie.<br /><br />I wonder if this will ever be a triology.<br />I can't see the plot for a third movie, but then again, I couldn't have predicted the plot for the second movie. 😂"

This movie is totally insulting to the Green Hornet franchise and if you are a Bruce Lee fan as I am he too would totally agree.. the original TV series is a hundred times better than this mistake of a movie.. and I definitely do not recommend  this JOKE. of a movie..👎👎👎👎👎

"If you haven’t seen this film, I feel sad for you. It’s brilliant, quirky, funny, and ties with Escape from New York as my favorite Kurt Russell performance ever (although Used Cars is also fantastic).<br /><br />Please, buy this before it’s gone. You won’t regret it. His lines are unforgettable and perfectly delivered. Everyone is fantastic in this John Carpenter romp through the hidden world; I only wish they’d done a sequel, but this is perfect as-is.<br /><br />A+<br /><br />Jeez, what are you waiting for? 😁"

"ROCK-A-DOODLE, even thought I am in my mid 60's, this has always been one of my favorite animated movies. (Probably because I adore GLEN CAMPBELL). The disc, when I opened it was covered with finger prints and had some scratches. I worried it would be defective in some way. I cleaned off the disc,, put it in the player, and watched a fantastic movie. No flaws !  COCK-A-DOO ...OO...O! 👍👍"

I boo got two of these 1 for me and one for my mom! I love this charger it charge your phone quickly and actually holds the charge! But one day I started smelling something burning had no clue it was the charger so I plug the charger in to my cigarette lighter not knowing it had already previously heated up before and it caught on fire!!!! I literally had to throw it out the window while I was driving and burned my hand on top of it! Maybe mine was just a defective it was AWESOME and I didn't leave home without it until that happened bummer 😞

"What a great solid 80s adventure;) If you’re a fan of Indiana Jones and Michael Douglas in general, you will love this film! Basically a romantic spoof of the Indiana Jones; a romance novelist tries to rescue her sister from kidnappers in Colombia! “Lady, you’re a jinx!” 😜"

The animation was incredible! It was slightly longer then I thought but that is not a problem lol.  The story kinda got drawn out but that is a small gripe with the story.  Still 5 stars 🌟 any.  I think the only real problem I have is that I thought it was a blue ray and digital version combo.

A dark and brooding movie.  Would have been nice if an opening statement saying this was based on a real person and a true experience(s). Very graphic and one could almost smell the stench of unwashed bodies and accompanying infections. 🤢🤭

"I love to relax with a movie 🎥 & 🍿. This older one is one of those that I rewatch now and then. And with Kathleen Quinlan staring in it, it’s a given. While it flopped at the box office, I remember that many others (like The Terminator) did too. I still enjoy this one and will get many more trips down memory lane with it."

This is great movie..and a great story..with great actors..it's like being on a roller-coaster ride.that starts out slow and then builds up the suspense and pause and then builds again but bigger..all the way to the end..but you must keep watching to get to the final ending..and thats where it leaves you with questions.. about the ending of the scene before the final ending Fade Out..🤔🤔🤔👍👍👍👍..5 stars

"The Original “OVERBOARD” with Kurt and Goldie can’t be beat. This is one of my favorite childhood comedies. The film is 5 stars, 👍👍. The price on this product was also great. When I ordered the Blu-Ray, I hoped the quality would be better than DVD. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have been remastered. Most likely my fault for not searching specifically for that. At least the Blu-Ray is more scratch resistant and I now have this excellent comedy back in my collection."

Shame on you Amazon for your deceptive practices of allowing the images not to match the product.  Just so disappointed as it was a gift that we took to our nephew for Christmas in another state. Now he has no way to watch it as they don’t have a blu-ray player, and I don’t have it to return it. 😡"

It’s great to see a movie that hasn’t been done before. I thought this movie hit all its marks in it’s uses of pop culture back when I was a kid in the 70s. To the music I listened to in the 70s and 80s and the the movies I watched in the 70s and 80s. I find myself watching this movie over and over again just to see if I missed any other pop culture references. I give two big thumbs up. 👍🏼 👍🏼

My oldest son moved to TX last September. Him & I always liked the movie Captain. One of my favorites movies. 😀 I came to visit him he asked if we were goi g to watch this movie while I was staying with him? I ordered the DVD from Amazon cause his cable co didn’t have Captain Ron on their list of movies.

"WHY, oh, WHY wasn't this made into a widescreen special edition?  Some of the special features are even in widescreen.  What in the world is up with that??  I enjoyed the special features, but wish there had been more (like a commentary).  I don't get why they wasted time in making this without using the widescreen format.  I feel like I've been taken.<br /><br />About the movie:  this is a favorite in our family.  It's a bit dark, and some people are upset by it, but there's a positive message and a happy ending (oops, was that a spoiler?)  I highly recommend it, and probably the best age to see this would be 6 or 7 and up, depending on how sensitive your child is.<br /><br />And of course, now it is available in widescreen. Took ‘‘em long enough. Still a favorite 😍"

"For those who only know Christopher Lee as Count Dooku from Star Wars, Saruman from The Lord of the Rings, or Scaramanga in The Man With The Golden Gun, it’s a treat to see his earlier work as Dracula. It’s amazing what he can do with his facial expressions (he does not speak in this iteration of the tale), not to mention his aristocratic bearing. No disrespect to Bela Lugosi, but I think of Lee as the more classic Dracula. And I will always love the way his icky servant, Clove, brings him back to life. The special effects for that scene were pretty good for their time. And when he meets his demise, it’s not in the unusual manner 😉"

This movie I’m surprised went to theater. I thought San Andreas movie was 💯 more better for being a new release movie. This movie looked very low budget and it was so boring. I also didn’t like that the movie was not in English so you had to read all the English with subtitles. I’m glad I didn’t buy this movie but my son did. If I was to grade the movie I would have given it a D-in all honesty.

Four vintage Disney films from the late 1950’s and 1960’s. Included is “Darby O’Gill and the Little People”. I have loved this movie 🎥 since childhood and like the others as well. This film features a young Sean Connery from his pre James Bond days.

"Many passionate Jane Eyre fans hate this adaptation. I have read the book more than once and I rather liked this version-- it doesn't maybe glorify the story to the fans, but it does accurately represent what the book looks like to the rest of us. The fans get upset about inaccuracies, but these are all just details. The essence of the Jane Eyre story is captured in this movie. An unhappy single woman falls in love with a rude cranky older guy. Turns out the guy is married, but it works out. There is beautiful scenery involved and a big house. Some spooky scenes.<br />The production is lavish and the actors excellent. Ciaran Hinds may not be the dashing hunk Rochester of legend, but he is the older man of the book. Sometimes I wonder if the Jane fans are mixing Rochester up with Teen Wolf. 😜 And Samantha Morton makes an elegant, attractive Jane.<br />Recommended."

Creature from the Black lagoon is one of my all-time favorite Sci-Fi movies from the 1950s and I love the two sequels. A lot of people don't know that this was the first trilogy in science fiction history. And it was planned out. These movies do not grow old they only get better with each viewing. I first saw this movie when I was about 13 years old and I fell in love with the creature. I felt sorry for him in a way in the third movie. I would have loved to seen a sequel to the third movie a 4th creature movie would have been cool.. but oh well 3 movies was good. If you love science fiction movies from the 1950s you got to get this box set and it's been digitally remastered and it looks great. Fun for the whole family 😄👍🏽

"It was a decent price but now I know why! The movie DOESN'T play all the way thru. It permanently pauses and then won't play anymore from thay point on. It was for my 5yr old turning 6. ☹Unfortunately, with all the chaos of covid 19😷 I didn't have time to return.  I don't recommend buying from here or, more importantly, buying used. At least not a dvd/cd. Stay safe, stay home, save lives!!!🙏✌"

"Alot of shooting, it is the Baraka market. Whatever they call it. First out, I bought the DVD, later I upgraded to Blu-ray 📀. Next step up, is go 4K. Great epic war action. Intense. Mindless. Getting everyone home, leave no man behind. Later today I will be playing on my projector. Full impact. Making my neighbour crazy jealous or deaf LoL. War junkies. Wash the blood."

"Leprechaun Returns is a sequel to the original and picks up right after the first movie. Warwick Davis sadly does not return this time, I know that may disappoint Lep fans hearing that. New comer Linden Porco has proven he’s got it too. If you enjoy horror comedy and special effects you’ll love this movie! Lot’s of gory moments and the special effects look top notch! For a made for tv movie I was very impressed! Leprechaun Returns is what the Leprechaun franchise needed after 2014’s disappointing Leprechaun Origins reboot. Linden Porco keeps you entertained with his wise cracking jokes and his quest for GOLD! Fans of the original Leprechaun movies will be pleased with this new entry. I’d highly recommend, it’s a golden good time! 🍀 5/5"

"Arrived on time and in good condition. The movie is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 well, as long as you actually liked the first Leprechaun movie! Good cheesy fun, back to it's roots. Continues from the original film's ending and retcons the other 6--ESPECIALLY that mutated horror flick of a #7 with an entirely different/dumbed-down Leprechaun......which was still amusing, it just wasn't leprechaun.<br />It was awesome to see the original characters, all these years later, continuing the story.<br /><br />This movie is nostalgic B-rated humor/horror at it's lowest peak. Highly recommend."

"WELL as I said , this movie was just okay and I say that because the two young superheroes they truly could have left out..or made them more mature..they had to do a rush job back story for BLACK ADAM..in fact he isn't given that name until the END of movie.. until then he was going by the name of Shazam but<br />( Shazam the vengeful Destroyer )..yes its a little confusing .and should be watched twice..NOW..the question<br />Is ,is Dwayne Johnson..going to going to keep playing "" BLACK ADAM ""..or will the replace him with someone else..like they did with "" BATMAN "".in cases like this they should always try  and find a totally NEW FACE to the big screen..to play a super hero..<br />For there we're only two actors that truly played BATMAN..WITH POWER..and that was Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck.. all the others were not as good..IN Batman vs superman ..thay showed a dream vision of ROBIN..that got killed by the joker..<br />And I wounder if they will make that move with Ben Affleck..because I think that would be a GREAT movie..<br />Anyway..this is my report on this costly movie..next time I will wait for a new movie to come out on net flicks .. to see if it is worth purchasing.👍👍..two thumbs up is all it will get from me.."

"Great date movie! 😉 I am surprised it is not acknowledged that this is a remake of the sequel of Creature from the Black Lagoon. Sci Fi geeks may enjoy getting the old movies and watching at least the first one before this one. There were 3 Creature from the Black Lagoon movies, and you can get all 3 for about $15 on Amazon."

"How certain people couldn’t relate to the protagonist of the movie is beyond me?  The film had an incredible story.  No.  The main character didn’t have a sexual encounter with a fish, but a different kind of species.  It just shows how still ignorant people are today.🙁"

Why would anyone sell a dvd for the UK region to me who lives in the USA??  It would not play!!  I have to go to all the trouble of sending it back.  What a hassle!!  I’ve tried to send it back and I keep getting it back😡😡😡
I can't stop watching them I love my collection 😍💕
Paul Bettany is outstanding in Priest & Legion. Both outstanding movies. Gabriel was a little slow but had a nice predictable twist at the end. This package is a very good deal! 💀

"The first great action movie with a boatload of stars and some to become stars (Donald Sutherland, for example).  The DIRTY DOZEN is directed by Robert Aldrich who had a knack for bravado movies like this with the surprisingly good humor (see The Longest Yard).<br /><br />Stalag 17 stars William Holden as the mistrusted American while the famous director Otto Preminger is convincing portraying the nazi camp Kommandant (shoot, sorry if spelled incorrectly 😑) and like Dirty Dozen is another classic action prison (escape) movie with some good humor too (I do kinda tire of Director Billy Wilder’s fondness for the Some Like it Hot, men dressing in drag humor.)<br />The commentary for STALAG 17 is worth listening to while watching.<br />4.4 stars for this fine WW II double feature."

Good movie. I like Johnnie Depp movies and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. I have to say this grossed me out a bit. 😝 But I'm glad I have it to add to my set.

A great documentary about an awesome drive-in theater ruined by f-bombs & other profanity; that language was really unnecessary. Do not watch this with young children! I really wanted to enjoy this. I’m sorry but I cannot recommend this dvd. 😢

"I liked this movie until it came to the 'my water broke!' part. What husband is more concerned over a waitress cutting herself than his wife emphatically trying to tell him something? Mine sure wouldn't!! 😊 An please don't tell me there are actually girls out there so low down as to try to get a pregnant woman's guy to pay her attention! I think that was low down of the script writers to write it let alone make some poor actress act it out... 😳 an the on the way to the hospital mishaps 😳 but the worst part was the birth room scenes- totally unrealistic!! I've had 5 babies myself- without any pain medication- an I never acted like that. An none of my friends ever acted like that when they had babies either! Also the 'fighting' between the two expectant fathers was totally stupid and an embarrassment to men in general. I've never seen men act so childish- especially when their wives are in labour. Robin Williams was awesome tho! His acting was over the top, of course, an kinda dumb, but his Russian accent was great! An I always love his wacky acting anyway :) anyway- this will definitely not make it in the dvd cabinet with the rest of our collection- it's off to Bookmen's to get traded for a good book 😃"

"For a satire on the Brady Bunch “phenomenon”it’s actually well done. All the characters nailed their roles.  Personally, I was more in line with the Monkees and the Partridge family’s targeted hipper audience. Ha!<br /><br />So when I saw this in a movie theater, I had a whole different appreciation for this “adult” Comedy. It’s REALLY Funny!  It’s like how to change a tire on a satire. The Brady Bunch was most unrealistic family on television and that’s saying a lot.<br /><br />However nowadays, I can actually see a Tenured role model like Mrs. Cummings ( A.k.a. a RuPaul Cameo) over your local public school’s guidance counselor office telling all Jan’s out there, “you better work-it girl.”<br /><br />This time is s a hilarious satire that has some frequent laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />Marsha , Marsha,  Marsha … Goddess from the mountaintop- just enjoy and have a sunshine day.  Everybody smiling  🙂<br /><br />Enjoy with 🍿."

Ha!<br /><br />So when I saw this in a movie theater, I had a whole different appreciation for this “adult” Comedy. It’s REALLY Funny!  It’s like how to change a tire on a satire. The Brady Bunch was most unrealistic family on television and that’s saying a lot.<br /><br />However nowadays, I can actually see a Tenured role model like Mrs. Cummings ( A.k.a. a RuPaul Cameo) over your local public school’s guidance counselor office telling all Jan’s out there, “you better work-it girl.”<br /><br />This time is s a hilarious satire that has some frequent laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />Marsha , Marsha,  Marsha … Goddess from the mountaintop- just enjoy and have a sunshine day.  Everybody smiling  🙂<br /><br />Enjoy with 🍿."
"This is a 4 pack of movies, each has their own disk which is nice. The movies also have cc/subtitles which is a plus for me!<br />I bought to add to my horror collection, I've already seen these before. If you're looking for a review of the movies themselves, they are solid horror movies, the exception being cabin 2, it's more campy horror, but good if you like that kind of thing (which I do 😊)"

"This is not a so-bad-it's-good movie. It's not a movie that's fun to watch with friends to mock it. It's a chore to sit though.<br /><br />The movie is soulless and the jokes are very one-dimensional. At the end of the day it is just a giant billboard for apps like Facebook, DropBox, Candy Crush, YouTube, and Just Dance. None of the product placements are subtle or creative; it's blatant and shameless.<br /><br />I will say there's something about Sir Patrick Stewart playing the role of his life; the Poop Emoji. 💩 And there was one clever joke about emotions. Other than that, it's a miserable slog.<br /><br />I wanted a legitimately terrible movie in my collection and now I do in all of it's 4K HDR glory. At some point I want to listen to the director commentary to hear exactly what was going though their heads when they created this monstrosity."

What a let down. The ending was the only interesting part. But barely worth having to sit through the rest of the film. Ugh 🙄

"So the first time this was “delivered” the package was empty. Not cut open or anything, they just didn’t put it in the package. BUT I got a credit and reordered it. I planned on giving 4 stars because of that but I’m so impressed with what I got that I’m giving all 5.<br />It comes in a metal dvd case with 3 discs. The movie disc & 2 bonus features discs. It also comes with 4 3D pictures (5x7 size.) PLUS you get a digital download of the movie too! That way you can play it anywhere, on any device. If your child is dory obsessed like mine it’s a huge bonus 🙌🏼😂<br />Plus it’s cheaper than in any store & in store you just get the movie dvd."

"Best movie of 2022 and now the test disc (like Top Gun before it) for audio home theater systems. Awesome soundtrack, spectacular aerial cinematography and a great story that continues and at times surpasses the 1986 classic. This is a must see for everyone.. even if you HAVE not watched the 1986 original.. you will after having experienced this… ‘great balls of fire’’😎"

"Outstanding and yet at times, extremely hard to watch. The rape of Nanking was no picinic.<br />Especially if you were Chinese.<br />  This film captures it all through the eyes of several different characters Japanese and Chinese alike.<br />  Outstanding direction and cinematography. All shot in a very stark black and white adding to the aire of death that oozes from this film.<br />  To this day many of the japanese soldiers that carried out thier orders are still very callus and disrepectful to the Chinese and remember this slaughter fondly ( other interviews ive seen) If you dont know how bad a human can be to another then watch this film. It may even change you a little..🤔"

"Please read no further, if you are concerned about spoilers...<br />While the private conversations are obviously created with tons of artistic license, this film 🎥 seems to stay very close to what is officially known and strays very little.<br />As the surviving brother after two were assassinated, no one can know what it was like to walk in Ted Kennedy's shoes.  Yet his own behavior in July 1969 appears to have been despicable.  Yet, America was eager to look the other way."

Love this movie.  Guys may think it's a chick flick but if you collect Boogie movies you need to add this.  It shows a different character personality for him but it's still unmistakable Boogie.  A fun film to snuggle up and watch 😉

Love the movie! At first disk skipped until I cleaned it. But I noticed the disk said disc two so maybe someone is being cheap and is buying a two disk set dividing it creating their own copy cover and reselling it?? 🤷🏼‍♀️ Anyway it was fine

"I have loved this movie since I was a child and I still love this movie now! I don't understand why this movie isn't played on tv as it should it be,  because it is in mind as much as a classic as Gone With The Wind and The Wizard of Oz. I sing and hum the songs from 7B47B more than WoZ! I even wanted so desperately to name my daughter Darkess, but I my (now x) husband said no way! Lol When I was growing up I went through phases of having crushes on all of the brothers and I wanted to be like all of the girls, but mostly Darkess, I think she was my first girl crush. Nevertheless, this movie was and still is amazing to watch and sing along to. I only have 3 wishes about this movie, 1. It should be played more. 2. It needs to be released in Blu-ray form. 3. Last,  but not least, I wish I was Darkess! Lol😉"

Brand new but seemed like it was a low quality DVD because it's really quiet in some spots which is really annoying 😑 and the screen is a small box and has no options to make the movie fit the actual tv so was actually pretty bummed with this purchase amd the case had some damage upon arrival.

...the packaging is beyond bulky.  Will anyone be making a custom box for those of us that want to display it with our other blu-rays and not as a coffee table book?🤔

My god the art is horrendous. It's untalented modern art vomit that looks like it was drawn by a 2 year old crack baby. I'm giving this a one rating just to make you mad. You----» 😭😭😭😭😭👬👬👬👬

"What I loved about this box set was all the older godzilla movies are now on blu ray, The Japanese version of King Kong vs Godzilla is on disc 8/bonus, I’ll settle for the sub titles, What I didn’t like was how the book is so big and hard for the disc to come out, So I went to Ebay and purchased the Godzilla showa original artwork, That’s right original artwork criterion collection with 2 4 disc storage blu ray storage cases for this awesome box set 🤩"

The movie arrived so quickly and no damage just the way we like it. Always use movies for a family movie night that brings us together regardless of age and have a family of Anime  addicts too. 🤷🏻‍♀️

"I just watched The Rock and found it excellent! I own Crimson Tide already and found that movie awesome as well. So, when I had to buy the two together in order to get an acceptable price of The Rock, I didn’t hesitate. It never hurts to have a backup of an excellent product! 😁"

Well for me I must say that this was an excellent excellent movie and well Worthy to add to your collection.. great actors a great script and a great love story.. and I gave it all five stars... the ending was great but it could have been... just.. a little bit better... they could have Frozen the frame with them in each other's arms and then start the credit roll and.. slowly.. slowly.. Fade to Black.. that would have been perfect in my book... but still a great movie and I highly recommend it..this is two great actors in their first movie together..and they are great...you will love this survival movie..👍👍👍👍👍

I got this dvd as a gift for my grandpa and when it came the case was extremely damaged as seen in the pictures. The dvd itself seems to be ok but the case was damaged from front all the way to the back. Very disappointed in delivery 😞

"I love love love this movie!! I used to watch it all the time when I was little and I still do on Netflix! Let me just say that if you haven't seen this incredible emotional movie than you are missing out! The story is heart touching and the music is so beautiful it makes you want to cry! This movie is perfect for children, adults, and families world wide! The Prince of Egypt is a fantastic movie about Moses who saved his people and gave them hope and faith that if they believe and stay strong miracles do happen! This movie also teaches you that miracles really do happen when you believe! 😭😃😜"

"This movie was not as good as I remember, also I would not ""Recommend"" this movie for anyone who is paranoid.<br />Expecially, if you think people are watching you!<br /><br />It would be a big mistake to watch,<br /> because it would make their paranoia<br /> alot worse.<br /><br />So, please use Caution if you are going to buy.<br /><br />I bought it, not realizing that this guy was that paranoid and I started watching it, around him which was a really bad idea.<br /><br />It is a good movie, to an extent. But, there are alot of things you need to be mindful of when buying it and when watching it, who is around and are they paranoid?<br /><br />This is why, I have given it 3-stars.<br /><br />You may give it more but I personally think it only deserves 3-stars, Expecially when it has seemed to make his paranoia worse.<br /><br />So, please use Caution when watching this video.<br /><br />Thank You! 😊"

"Wow. I am a big Doris Day fan, but this movie was super disappointing. All of her movies are corny and have the same type story line, but they're good clean humor and fun that you can watch with your kids, but even my 8 yo, who loves old movies (she knows all the movie stars from the 30's through the 50's as if they were the current stars!), left to go play. 😞👎"

"I did see 🙈 this movie 🎥 on TV decades ago. Nostalgic feelings were the reason I purchased it. I don't want to spoil the ending, but, I didn't realize people were saying this movie 🍿 was a representation of ""suppressed housewives"" or the ""woman's movement"".<br />The commentary doesn't have anyone who worked on the film 📽️. One commentary is three guys rambling on. The other is a film historian who has interesting facts, but, she goes on and on.<br />If you can get this movie at a low price, give it a try."

"Many people tend to give this film a lower rating than it deserves, due to its difference from the previous film (Sin City 🌆). That's not fair at all. This one is every bit as good, because you MUST keep in mind that this one is an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORY. It has some Characters from the 1st film, and some of them are presented in Past Tense (prequel story to the 1st film) and some are presented in Current Tense (picking up where the last film left off at), and this film has some past Characters represented in this film, but played by another Actor/Actress (Michael Clarke Duncan[R.I.P.] and the Character of 'Miho' now portrayed by Jamie Chung [I don't know why the original Asian woman wasn't available for the sequel]. This film is every bit as intense, action packed, mysterious and its story is every bit as cohesive as the 1st film. Please. Give it a shot. I hesitated all this time to see it for the aforementioned reasons, but I gave it a chance the other night 🌃 and IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS, ordered it on Blu-Ray from Amazon.com! 😀"

Despite the low rating & bad reviews from critics this was a damn good movie. Love it!! They were probably butthurt because The White House was being attacked which could actually happen whether people like or not. Loads of action for me so even better. 😁

So when I had the idea to get it for my brother for Christmas, I was ecstatic that I was able to find it on Amazon. He lost his mind when he opened it. Our mother rolled her eyes LMBO. He opened and watched it the same day. He loves it. So thank you to the merchant who sold it and thank you amazon. 😊👍"

"This is a wonderful movie, it’s  actually more than one movie, a wonderful collection of  animation music and movies by  Michael Jackson , I was amazed to find it on amazon. My children are all grown now but when they were 1,3 and 5 it was one of their favorite movies to watch in our home. Not to many people seem to be aware of Moonwalker by  Michael Jackson. I’m still grateful that my babies grew up watching this! I have the most  precious videos of them watching this together, 5 yr old big brother would have to get up( eyes glued to the tv) and start dancing then little sister age 3 would start dancing too! My treasures of their childhood. I have now gotten one for my granddaughter and will be getting one for my baby Grandson very soon! It’s a couple hours long filled with all sorts of  exciting entertainment for the kids they won’t get bored,<br />Mine sure didn’t, Thank you Amazon for<br />Making it possible for my grandchildren to have Moonwalker too 👏🏽👏🏽🥰"

"My 9 year old daughter used her own money to buy this eve as a gift for her 2 year old brothers birthday.<br /><br />He adores anything Peter Rabbit at the moment.<br /><br />The movies are a little cheesy. But overall entertaining for children. I don’t find them too vulgar. We’ve watched the second movie more, in some parts it reminds me of those British gang type movies. Lock stock and barrel and such.<br /><br />But now we’ve seen it a thousand times 😆 and my littlest ones quote the movies and sing the songs.<br />My oldest son is 19 and hates them but he doesn’t like the voice actor for Peter. He says he’s surrounded by bad press in real life. I don’t know of him very well but his voice doesn’t annoy me. These movies are less annoying to me than those Peter rabbit cartoons you can stream online.<br /><br />There are some very over exaggerated action scenes but they kind of make me laugh when Mr McGreggor is thrown about. Very unrealistic. Over comical. For me it isn’t the worst movie to have your child obsessed with. For some it may be!<br /><br />The actor of Mr. McGreggor is the real life son of Mad Eye Moody and he played Bill Weasley in the Harry Potter movies. He high pitch screams a lot in these movies."

"I didn’t know what to expect based on the trailers. Those snippets do the film a complete disservice. You think it’s just some fight movie with shallow substance and Viola as the star and turns out to be almost a coming of age story with “newbie” actress Thuso and an ensemble cast that almost outshines Davis completely.<br /><br />The movie is in the genre of HISTORICAL FICTION which is a REAL genre that the likes of “Braveheart”, “300” and “Gladiator” all were under and yet few people held any of those films to some standard of delivering 100% accuracy. 🙄 (I mean really, Marcus Aurelius wanted to “return Rome back to a republic” and pass leadership to a fictional soldier? Sure)<br /><br />Anyway fight scenes are fantastic, no CGI or stunt doubles here which is why it has the feel of “Gladiator”.<br /><br />Great film!"

"Anorexic Caucasian college student with family comes back home and wants to become a poet.  Has to take job at sex shop.  Whines, behaves indignantly when asked to do her job, is somehow beloved by every stranger who crosses her path.  This film is rated highly by others who fit the above mentioned stereotype.  For the rest of us, we recognize it for the turd it is.  💩"

"It came early but did have a few rips on the back of the cover. The DVD is in English. It played well and didn't skip. It came with both disc. I wasn't able to find it at any store.  Some of the other reviews said it wasn't for younger viewers if you haven't already seen this movie there are a few things you might not want your kids seeing. For example, people smoking, people getting eaten, and monsters. It is a really cute movie with a small love story. It's interesting and different. I would recommend it. 😊"

Arrived on time. Great movies 😁
I just love these movies😂
"So I put Friday in with my family and soon notice that this seems to be a different Friday, one I've never seen before. Nowhere does the packaging state that it's a director's cut.  It is horrible. I took it out.  I feel cheated. So, if you're looking for the original Friday this isn't it. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽...now let's check the rest of the movies..."
I just recieved my movie collection....and was excited about getting it but when i opened the package it was only 2 disc.Friday after next and all about the Benjamin's WHERES MY OTHER 2 😡😡😡 i can only rate 2 till i get my other movies...

"Based on the graphic novel The Rocketeer by Dave Stevens Disney produced The Rocketeer for a 1991 release to little fan fare and a box office flop.  Most critics liked it though—including the famous Chicago newspaper movie reviewers Siskel and Ebert who gave it ‘Two Thumbs Up!’ (see DVD box cover)—finding it easy to ignore the obvious (realism) flaw in the flame spewing jetpack:  wouldn’t it burn the back of the users legs?<br /> (My) Another complaint is the Germans wanting this jetpack so badly.  Why?  Would they really believe invading a country with a hundred of these pilots flying a jetpack with no cover would be the key to an army’s invasion success…?  Dropping hand grenades?  Carrying a machine gun?  The pack is fast but…(the Nazi propaganda animation sequence is great by the way) anyways, Disney turned this into a fun adventure film with a PG rating.  The final result is a movie that is just as fun for the adults as the kids.  The avid film fans will enjoy the Hollywood references—right down to the reason The Hollywood sign no longer reads Hollywoodland.<br /><br />The Rocketeer, also, has a solid cast.  The always dependable and sometimes very comical Alan Arkin is the air plane (and then some) mechanic.<br />Paul Sorvino is the intelligent (of course) head of the mob.<br />Ed Lauter is the hard nosed 1930’s FBI agent.<br />Terry O’Quinn is an inspired casting as inventor—and not yet ‘phobic’—Howard Hughes.<br />As most know and/or have pointed out,  Timothy Dalton comes as close as can be to stealing the (already entertaining ) show with his portrayal of the Hollywood swashbuckling legend based on Errol Flynn.<br />Jennifer Connelly is stunning in her white dinner dress; and becomes a helpful cog against the evil Nazi plan, not just a damsel in distress.<br />The unknown Bill Campbell was cast—as the story goes—quite intentionally; with names Kevin Costner and Johnny Depp passed over with little regret for the lead by Director Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park 3).<br />Action and ‘flying’ special fx hold up very well for a movie now 31 years old (2023).<br />The Rocketeer is a splashy and occasional camp cheese mix (it’s the 1930’s) of speculative fact and even more 1930’s styled, ‘serial cliffhanger’ fiction.<br />4.6 stars<br />Widescreen The Rocketeer flies by at 108 minutes in glorious color.  Why did The Rocketeer bomb at the box office is a good question.  Like B movie critic Joe Bob Briggs used to say:  ‘Check it out.’<br />The Rocketeer coming to your DVD (or Blu-ray?) player, soon😁😉"

I bought this Special Edition & it’s suppose to be 2 discs. That is how it’s described in the description but it’s only 1 disc. There is suppose to be a clip-in insert that holds the other disc. I let Amazon know about this & they tried to make it right by sending me another copy but it also was only 1 disc also. I think they need to change the description 😕

"I really, really, really loved this movie. Even my husband enjoyed it. Some critics complained that Rik's acting wasn't emotional enough, but that was the point of the character.  The book was great too, and movie was actually true to it. I didn't feel like they were two separate stories as often happens.  Buy both.  And no, I am not a paid endorser, friend, employee or relative 😁"

Ann  Margret's opening and closing number in this film is beautiful and Blu-ray. Fun musical with a lot of fun songs good dance numbers. Ann Margret shines throughout the film.😆 Too bad there wasn't some extra since many of the cast members are still alive.

Read about the history of the home releases on this and wanted the real widescreen. Always grew up with 4:3 pan & scan version. Very cool to have the full 2.35:1! Hope this gets a Blu-Ray release sometime soon! 🥳

"Oh my goodness!  I and my entire family were just ""awe"" struck by the animated, yet real-life like characters in this movie.  A family movie indeed that will bring out every emotion you own; including joy, sadness, feelings of triumph as you cheer for she and her loved ones.  Wow!  Alitia, certainly surprises everyone and she certainly is no weakling but one ""amazing"" Battle Angel.  Just trust me you all need to see this movie because it won't disappointed.  ( watched it x3 already) 😄"

Good acting/casting/story ~ picture quality Avgs.1/2 of a quality BD Disc at 16 MBPS! So sad (very “grainy”) also as an effect?? The whole pic was shot as if the camera 🎥 lens had been spray painted with a golden tint ~ a very odd effect in my opinion indeed!

"The UCLA film foundation did a great job mastering from archival 35MM elements to bring a much improved viewing of The Chase a cult classic that was a competitor at the 1947 Cannes Film Festival.<br /><br />Not only was director Arthur Ripley an oddity in his own right (just six films to his credit) producer Seymour Nebenzal and cinematographer Franz Plane both worked in German Expressionism in the 1920’s.<br />This turned out to be a great fit for the look of this dream mare of a movie, part film noir, part art film.<br />The Chase also gets a cooly cold, did anyone smoke his film noir cigarettes as suave and effortless—or as well—as Peter Lorre?<br /><br />Robert Cummings as Chuck Scott is the soldier home from WW2.  His performance is subtle and belies Scott’s difficulties from post traumatic stress.<br />Michelle Greene portrays the lovely unhappy wife of Miami mafia boss Roman played by Steve Cochran.  One of the best (artsy) scenes<br />is when (is it a dream) the two lovers to be(?) are on a pier looking out over the ocean imagining Havana Cuba in their future.  Her clothes change as time passes(?) as they talk.  Is this more than one visit or is Scott imagining things.<br />By the time the movie physically concludes /ends you will be wondering the same question.  Was that real or part of a dream?<br /><br />Again, UCLA and Kino Lorber Classics has restored The Chase very well.  My previous double feature that includes Bury Me Dead pales in video comparison.  Not a question how much improved the Kino dvd is!<br />4.3 stars<br />My only complaint (see my back cover photo)<br />Is the commentary by ‘filmmaker Guy Maddin<br />(The Forbidden Room)‘ doesn’t seem to exist.  At least I can’t get it to work but I still luv The Chase restoration. 👍"

"Such a good early 90s movie... I love it. If you're a fan of Kilmer and Greene you will really like this movie. Perfect cast of actors, including Sheila May Tousey... exciting, emotional, kept me interested until the end. In fact, when it was over... it left me wanting a part 2 ( ! ) Too bad they did not make another one. Also, the movie would not have been as effective without Marvin Thin Elk, Sr. The man was stellar ! Even the dog (&#34;Jimmy&#34;) did a great job 😊 ❤️."

"Wonderfully surprised at how great these dvd's looked on my blu-ray player! Also the package came undamaged and disc in great condition. This was a STEAL for $11! It's the usual cardboard box that mill creek entertainment uses for most of their movies with the cardboard sleeves.  I always take the disc out and put them in better sleeves and stick them back in the box along with the empty cardboard sleeves to take up the extra room in the box. This is a great cartoon for children and adults.  Clean, funny,entertainment! I'm 54 and still love my cartoons. The older ONE'S especially. You want go wrong with Dennis the menace!🤣😂🤣"

Classic movie from my younger days.  I would have loved to get it on Blu-ray but it isn't available on that format.  It is available on DVD and it looks plenty good for being an older movie from the 90's.  The sound quality is fine but I noticed that when we watched it in our home theater that I had to have the volume up a little more since the volume was much quieter at our regular volume for newer up to date movies on Blu-ray or DVD formats.  It still bumped the subwoofer during certain parts but just noticed the record level was a little lower than others.  It happens but doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment of this classic teen movie.  There are no director notes or commentary or really any type of special features on this DVD.  Just the original trailer and the movie itself. The price was right for this classic in my opinion.  I hope this review helped someone out there.  👍
"This has always been a personal favorite of mine, and I watch it like 10 a year. Why? BECAUSE!!! 😡<br /><br />My only gripe is that the nostalgic classic rollerblade commercial (of the dude rolling down the hill past the hit chick with flowers) isn't in the beginning to build the suspense to make popcorn.<br /><br />Otherwise, great copy, very pleased."
One of my favorite movies. Thanks Amazon i love my job 😁😍
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 One of the best movies people never heard of such a great movie
Won't play beyond 5 minutes. Trash 👎🏼
"Colossus. The Forbin Project is a wonderful hidden gem. Eric Braeden, a stellar cast with Joseph Sargent direction and James Bridges screenplay of D. F. Jones novel. Has had me clamoring for another movie since I first saw it on TV back in 1971. It's a movie that asks the question how far is too far.  Now we come to the other star of this movie, Colossus. Well, I'm not going to give away anything.  Give it a watch 😉."

Remembered it as being funnier when it first came out but still well worth a watch with it's innuendo's and obvious Looney Toon'ish pratfalls! probably 3 1/2 Stars now but still well worth a watch 😂
One of my favorites from the 70's.still makes me laugh 😄 after all these years.
"A well acted and much deserved reboot of a series that continues to have great potential. It's amazing what movies like Avengers Captain America Gaurdians, etc. can do to remotivate the competition.  With the global success of the Marvel studios DC and Sony along with fox has their hands full simply trying to keep up. We the audience will be the victors. Let the competition for our movie dollars begin😝"

"I was left shaking my head, saddened and disgusted!! This film tells the life story of Civil rights Activist and Black Panther Fred Hampton and the prominent work he did for Soical change during the Civil rights movement, but midway through the film Fred was Brutally murdered by the Chicago PD and the despicable attempt to cover it up! Despite the sobering reality of how civil rights leaders risked their lives fighting against Soical injustices, Fred Hampton's legacy was established and continues today!👍 #Powertothepeople!🔥🔥🔥"

Just one of my best movies ever.  Robert Downey like you have never seen him before.  It was loving sad and heart warming all at once. A must see.  I would never have said that a year ago. Watched it by accident 😁

"I thought I'd watch this and bring something positive to the table. I thought &#34;These people saying part 2 was good must've been intoxicated when they watched part 2 if they honestly liked it, because it was barely even comparable to part 1&#34;. Well, since reviews are about opinion, I'll share the short side of mine without giving the full script. No kidding...part 3 is actually miles worse than part 2, and that takes talent. Part 2 was about a bunch of guys that couldn't even act straight, and the whole movie mainly took place on a bus. How much worse could it be, right? Evidently if someone is creative enough, anything is possible, and part 3 really does make the second in the series look good...somehow. Since I said I wouldn't write the script, my small piece I'll argue besides the already well documented &#34;It made it worse by making the film in daylight&#34;, which is true, what I didn't like is something that a lot of the &#34;haters&#34; claimed the fans would like, which is the creeper. The Creeper is now very humanized. He looks like a dude with a black facial mask on (seriously). He has big traps (the muscles around the neck area...not literal traps), and the thing about the old Creeper was he was barely surviving, skinny, and insanely strong. The strength with a smaller frame in films 1 & 2 made it appear more so like he was a creature with a super power instead of a dude who'd been working put while simultaneously hibernating. Anyway, my explanation is probably terrible. So bring on all of the thumbs down, but if you want to watch this after reading this review...don't say I didn't warn you. Everything everyone says is true, from terrible CGI to every other complaint. It isn't good if you like the Creeper, nor the truck, nor the story. It's all washed out. I gave it 2 generous stars because with most of the world now understanding how bad things can get, now that we have garbage on Netflix to compare to, I gave it a fair rating against all film, and all in all it doesn't completely make you want to end your life, but it will not inspire you in any way either, except maybe to go to sleep.<br /><br />P.S. A friend just sent me a message, haha! &#34;You said this one couldn't be worse. You wuz wrong 😮&#34; Ah, yes, I was wrong. It is worse."

"I saw this movie when I was maybe a bit too young (hounded parents, I was the baby of the family 😁) and it truly, literally scared me. The special effects being decades old may take away from it a tad now but there will never be another movie that doesn't borrow from it in some way. Excellent in every way. The book is even more hardcore."

"This is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever watched. Having gone deer hunting a lot in my youth, the film accurately depicts most of the ritual things Brothers do as well as other family members who may or may not actually hunt. I recommend this film for anyone who has ever been to &#34;deer camp&#34;. With the zany addition of things you will not see coming at you until they get there, the mostly comedy events are very well done.  I can watch this movie over and over again and still find subtle things I missed before. Great Fun !  👍🏻"

"A sweet documentary about a ballroom dance competition that takes place annually in NYC. Several NYC school districts participate. They teach the 5th graders how to ballroom dance. There are different levels of competition & finally there is a winner. A trophy is awarded which stands taller than most 5th grade students. Each time I watch it, I tear up at the announcement of the winners 🏆. I live in the neighborhood of the winners & today, they are young adults in their 20's - 30's. IMO, a film for the entire family."

"I haven't seen this movie since I was ten. It was on the Late night Monster Theater. It was the first horror film I treated like a mystery/thiller, because we see what the victims see or think they see, and it's Dana Andrews disbelief then his slick solution and the shocking twist.(Man, I hope I'm not giving anything away.)I'm so happy to have the full British movie and the American version. I love them both 👍."

Very disappointed! This won’t play on our dvd player as it’s not 4K. There is no mention in any description or write up about it having to be played on a 4K HD TV and a 4K DH Blue Ray Player. It took months to come and now can’t play it or return it! 😠
Best tom cruise movies ever made…also as to those reviews that say theg cant plag the dvds in their dvd player…it should be well known by now that 4k ultra hd blu rays or regular blurays are not playable in a dvd player…also their is no racism or white supremacy in these movies whatsoever…if that is the case then black panther is extremely racist….and so are pretty much all jordan peele movies and i could probly go on all day long…but i am agrown adult and dont care about color whatsoever🙂
Ordered by mistake and to late for an exchange movie. 🥲🥲🥲

"Great movie from a great seller (ddanq001).  Great combo😀<br />This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It is pretty violent (might be an understatement), not for the faint of heart.  It was just so incredibly well done, so many twists and turns, so dark.  Min-Sik Choi is a fantastic actor.  If you like this movie you might want to check out I SAW THE DEVIL, as well.<br />If you like violence (movie wise), an amazing yet disturbing story, twists and turns, yet very well done...so different than American movies- you should like this one."

"I really do not understand why this movie does not have higher ratings! Whether or not you agree with how it ended does not matter it’s the contents in between! Kinda like a Twinkie or an Oreo all the good stuff is on the inside! This movie is so parallel to what is going on today and this movie was made in 2016! If you pay attention, you will really get the message that it is trying to convey! Excellent excellent excellent movie✅💯❗️"
"I have already seen the movie, and I enjoyed it. I have also watched the episodes when they were on tv. Now I can do a marathon of the episodes in one day! 😁"
A worthwhile investment 👌 is the most exciting thing I can say.
"One of my favorite campy films, it’s just too much fun. This transfer is a little off at times where picture meets sound, but that is an unfortunate issue we must deal with due to studio contracting and production funding for the BluRay release. Wish I could say it’s the disc, but it’s not (so be warned, and I bought it anyway despite knowing that before hand…) A real bummer, so I might replace it if it ever gets fixed… enjoying it all the same! Highly recommended for sh!+s and giggles unless you are just one of “those” people.😋"

"I liked both Animal and Ebert, Roche. Animal and his quick quips….Excellent a threesome, I’m a little tired😂and Ebert with his fascination of chocolate kisses, and Roche because he couldn’t get the right coffee to drink. It had to be French Roast or nothing! The last scene was what made it for me, when he took a drink of his coffee and he made that face and he said I thought you said, this was French Roast!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"

"Dialog stifled, green screen quite poor. Extraneous plot elements. More of a soap opera than any cinematic value. Terrific waste of horse power, they did fine. 🐎"

"I have been looking for this movie for decades!! I ordered after reading the plot hoping that it would be the one I was looking for; and it was! What happened was that it was released in the US back in the early 70’s with the title “The Tempter”. Not “The Antichrist”. I am super pleased that my quest for this particular movie had positive results!!<br />And YES it was overshadowed by “The Exorcist”. But it is a scary Italian type movie.<br />If you like the Italian horror movies such as The he Demons Trilogy, Tenebrea and others you will love this one.😀"

$750 for a used movie disc? Good one!😵😏😝😲... that Really must be the apocalypse.  Get real u crazy... Lol  unless your Mel Gibson himself selling his own used signed copy .....  I guess you could always hope someone accidentally buys it and you get rich accidentally selling all your  extreme overpriced used stuff. You must really like that movie and think your used things are very special!

I actually found this to be one of Johnny Knoxville's better films.  Formula is very similar to Bad Grandpa but better developed.  Loved the story and retro setting.  I have also always been fascinated with the actual story this was based off of.  If you got some time to kill and are a fan of Knoxville's previous offers or nostalgic coming of age flicks like Adventureland etc. then I highly recommend giving this one a view.  ✌😎
"This is a &#34;must see&#34; movie for women and then for significant others, so they can understand the struggle that is faced every day!🙏👍👍"

A must see."

A heart-warming movie for the ages based on a wonderful book by Dick King-Smith entitled BABE: THE GALLANT PIG. Saw it with my children and I still watch it and give the DVD to friends. Most highly recommended!<br />Note the climactic Grand National Sheep Dog Trials take place in the King-Smith Showground. 😊

Billy Jack a pop classic brought to life by the Late Tom Laughlin.<br />All 3 Billy Jack movies on 2 DVD's .<br />Lots of action set in the late 1960's and early 70's. I really enjoyed all 3 movies.<br />The three of Tom Laughlin as Billy Jack are hard to find. Great buy 👍👍 👍

"Bought the 2 disc version for the nostalgia of VHS days but this set cuts off in a different part than the old movies did. Still works great, now I just have to get up in the middle of the movie for no reason 😂"
Awesome movie!! Awesome seller!! ❤️❤️😎😎
"It came. But blew into the road, got ran over in the street 🤦🏻‍♂️"
"Absolutely twisted, depraved, and warped! I loved it! Totally original, adult comedy-horror, so bizarre, and wacky you can’t help but fall in love with the characters. The director Jim Hosking is remarkably brilliant! His other movie is equally enjoyable; that being, An Evening with Beverly Luff Linn. Please realize that The Greasy Strangler is wickedly, and disgustingly hilarious, if that’s even possible!?! All I can say is, buy this insanely funny...and “touching” movie. That’s no bulls**t coming from a BULLS#IT ARTIST!! Check out the equally bizarre OST CD as well!😹🎨🎸👍🏼 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

All Tom Cruise's M.I. movies are action-packed.  I love this kind of movie. They are all action-packed but they are all different. That is why I will always watch every single one of them 😉.

"Five stars because I loved this show as a teen and now watching as a parent, it's just as good and like watching it new because of the different perspective. 😊<br /><br />Also, the packaging! First off, I don't like reviews that taste low because of damages. I think it's unnecessary because Amazon refunds or replaces your product! The only issue I had was every season has 6 discs except the final season which has 5. Since it's odd, the last disc is by itself on the casing and it just happened to be detached. There was a spot for it, so it wasn't just there to linger. It just must not have been tight and came loose completely. It works and there are no scratches. If there were, I'd simply return. I'm just sharing to let to check the discs when you receive it.<br /><br />Other than that, love the packaging. It's clean and organized well. I'm glad to have it as a box set instead of every season in an individual casing."

"A good but not great sci-fi movie from 1964 starring<br />Preston Foster,Merry Anders,John Hoyt and Dennis<br />Patrick concerning a team of college scientists who<br />experiment with time travel and create a portal that<br />will let traverse between past and future.Well,as with<br />many opuses of this genre,something goes wrong and<br />they get stuck and have to try to find their way back.<br />They do get back…just not in the manner they wished.<br />Suspenseful at times,hokey at times,it’s a delightful<br />way to unhook your brain for 90 minutes or so.<br />Last time I saw this flick was in 1985 when it was put<br />out on VHS by Thorn-EMi Home Video.The picture is<br />Blu Ray quality and miles above that of the deceased<br />VHS format.Well worth the 19.95 or so that Amazon’s<br />asking for it.This time around you can be kind and NOT<br />rewind.Just pop it out when it’s over and forget it.<br />Pretty good mid 60’s escape from the everyday and I<br />recommend it.Three stars,check it out!!!👍"

"I really loved Penguin Highway!<br /><br />I gave this animé movie a chance as I was looking for something different, it sounded interesting, and you should go looking for it, too.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that leave you with an uplifting sense of wonder.  The feeling that something magical just happened, and when you go outside later, you can expect to see penguins running amok in your backyard or just around the corner.<br /><br />Penguin Highway will charm you. It has a very interesting perspective of life in the multiverses that expands our own little world, and how interesting we are. And how much mystery is out there for us to discover.<br /><br />If the story hasn't captured you by the [end?], the closing song, Good Night, by Hikaru Utada will set you into flight and you'll be entranced for long after.<br /><br />Life exists, explore, discover, expand.<br /><br />Good Night. 😉"

"Movie is great. No issues there. One of my FAVS. Really teaches appreciation for what is important in life. Although others may see it differently, that is why I love this movie so much. Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni have great chemistry in this Christmas flick.<br /><br />Two things I have issues with. Nothing that can't be fixed. And nothing to get our tail feathers in a twist about, but still, it does need to be noted.<br /><br />1) Mine like others does also have the sticker affixed to the front of the package (see in attached picture) stating digital copy included. However, I did not anticipate any included as I always read the descriptions of products throughly before purchasing. Had it said &#34;Blu ray + Digital included&#34; in the description, I would have been a bit frustrated opening the package to find it was not included. BUT, it never states that on the description, so can't complain. It would have been SUPER for a digital copy to be included in this price, as like Walmart does for many of their $7 buck blu ray + digital combos. 😊<br /><br />2) The other issue is, the copy I actually received is defective. In playing the movie, every 4 seconds there is a skip/shutter to the film. And it continues from before the movie starts to throughout. Can't get past this one. It's just too much to be able enjoy the movie as intended. The disk itself looks to be good, smooth and without scratches. However, it still skips/shutters every 4 seconds. So I will be returning and attempting to purchase another in hopes it will be without the latter issue.<br /><br />Other than that, shipping was fast and on time. Bought it in the &#34;Same Day Prime&#34; before noon. Arrived that evening about 9 pm. Happy about that. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide on a purchase.<br /><br />Will update with new copy I receive. (Hopefully minus the skip/shutter) Happy watching!!"

"This may be the new best entry in the cannibal genre!! When I watched it I couldn't believe I hadn't heard about it sooner. Insanely realistic performances, plenty of special effects done flawlessly. This movie is a 10 out of 10. I can't recommend it enough if you like gory and disturbing films!!! You can thank me later 😊"

"The actual movie is an easy 5 stars! The disc tho is only 2, it plays fine until 42:37 when it just freezes and you cannot even fast forward. Depressing as my 4 year old just LOVES this movie and we watched it so much on Netfxxx that he can act out almost every scene! Hope the replacement works 😀"

"This is a classic movie! Our grand daughters loved it ! Of course we love it. It's one of our favorite's. Like Uncle Buck and  The Great Outdoors. I could go on but it would be 700 words by then!! Do get it's, it's worth it.. 😊"

"A very underrated movie.  Better than Napoleon Dynamite in my opinion. Should have been a bigger movie and shown nationally!  Great and quirky Indie film I love watching again and again.  Seth Packard did a phenomenal job as writer, director and star of this movie.  And remember, 'We're all cousins!' 😁"

"Superb transfer, especially when compared to my previous version Donnie Darko Blu-ray, which was really, really, dark. Great video quality. Five stars!!!<br /><br />My only complaint was the disc holder sleeve case. I’m not sure why they make them so crappy, as you can see in the picture, the disc is held in place by two thin pieces of tiny curved plastic, which broke immediately upon removing the disc for the first time. Annoying and frustrating. 😑😑😑"

"I seen this twice on tv as a kid and seen it for the 3rd time somewhere last decade. First time was in the 90s and second time in, I think my second year of living in Modesto. Story short, about a teenage video game nerd who found a way to win a prize to have the first copy of a toy robot, that is two and a half feet tall, plays games in action fun. But, what he doesn't know is that the toy wasn't originally a toy at all 😱 This movie didn't get enough good reviews at its time. But, it's better than the negatives. From the director of The House On Sorority Row brought us this thrilling movie that can make ya never want a real toy robot in your life, not even a city away from you. So, if you like the idea of a scary toy robot, I recommend this one 👍😎<br />P.s.. The toy robot, Evolver is voiced by William H. Macy. Great choice they did 😉"

"She hadn’t heard of this movie so I told her I’d get and watch it. Of course I made egg drop soup, shrimp toast and sweet and sour chicken plus a Mulan costume to complete the show. She loved it—and so did I. Told my 28 yr old son I had seen it again. He started laughing and said did you dress her up like you did me? I did not dress him up as Mulan but made his dad bring me back little boy pants and embroidered top fro his business suit in China…I had bought him a sword to go with it. 🥴🤗😆 Guess I will always be looking ke that. It was fun—both times!"

"Excellent Disney film. It has two stories in one movie. The first one is about the feisty Mr.Toad who gets in and out of trouble. The second is about Ichabod Crane a school teacher in love with the farmer's daughter, and mysteriously disappears upon running away from ""the headless horseman."" A take on Sleepy Hallow 🎃. This classic is worth watching."

"First off Matt Damon (love)  and all the actors were great. But the director didn't understand that leaving the story to grow expands the story. Instead this movie was cut for the ADD crowd, not the old Bourne followers. It's the cutting that's the issue here,  not the car crashes as mentioned before. One shot cuts to the next in seconds  The fault clearly lies with the director.  I suggest watching it first before buying it.  As it is I will pass unless the director addresses the faults in the 1000 cuts in this film. I'm sad it wasn't up to par with the older Bourne films. Very,  very sad. 😔"

DVD broken when we received it. Couldn't return it due to kids losing the case during a cross country drive...must have fallen out at a rest stop some place. Really disappointed that it came broken. It was a birthday present and her favorite movie. 😭

"This 1995 film concerns adoption, racial ideas in Black/white American relations, crack addicts, ghettoes, and class differences.  Yes, it hits all the hot buttons and is still a good story 21 years after the production.<br /><br />First we have Halle Berry, skinny and crack addicted, with a new black baby son called Isaiah, living in abandoned and empty apartments.  She has no husband. And of course no job and no family.  Only an infant son who is screaming his head off, because he was born a crackhead, too, and is very easily irritated: whew boy!<br /><br />Meanwhile an upscale married couple, Father an architect and mother a social worker, with a preteen Daufhter, live in an nice brownstone.  As the mother in her work encounters violence and abuse and drug addiction to the point that victims are brought to the hospital for society to straighten out, she receives Isaiah rescued from the crunch of a garbage truck at the last minute, almost dead, left in a box by the crackhead mother.  The baby survives with extreme intervention, thank you Chicago taxpayers, and the social worker falls in love with him.<br /><br />Yes, she decides to adopt him and her husband agrees.  Imagine that!  Teen daughter Hannah is less than keen but helps a lot with babysitting as the parents are working.  Resentment of all the attention the baby gets is natural for her.<br /><br />What happens to the crackhead mother?  She ateals from a grocery store very blatantly and gets arrested.  Court is merciful and send her to rehab.  There she finally learns to READ!!  Then she is forced into work and becomes a daytime babysitter for a small white child with working parents in a well-Off district.  Ironically when she does find out her son isn't dead and tracks down the adopted parents, toddler Isaiah is taken care of by a white teen babysitter and they meet at the park, all four of them!<br /><br />Halle Berry is outstanding as a surly black young drug addict and scofflaw.  Father of her baby is unknown to her but she claims at her hearing that she never a prostitute; she only needed the money for drugs. She shows a Very Worn and weary foster kid of the ghettoes. As she goes through rehab and then begins an honest job, her face and demeanor change for the bette with an occasional smile.  She remains as skinny as drug addicts often are and has moments of looking mannish with muscles and long neck but other times, especially with make-up, hair cut and old style print dress with lace collar, she starts to seem a good-looking woman. I have to admit that I didn't know she was black American.  I thought she was part Easr Indian or Caribbean mixed race. I'm not up on American actors.  Her child Isaiah is much darker than she.<br /><br />The child was a fantastic natural.  Whether crying or throwing a tantrum or laughing or playing, he is superb😜!  How did they get such a young kid to do all this?  Using chocolate and candy?  His screaming fit in the back seat was outstanding.  Very very very real!<br /><br />Ultimately the movie is a satisfying mix of different points of view on race and separation of a mother from her child.  Lawyers are very good at bringing up unpleasant facts from both sides.<br /><br />Rather than reveal the surprise ending, I can only say that both sides of this adoption battle had validity and I can't say who is really right.  Or rather both sides are right in their way, but what is best for the child?  Our own president was raised by white grandparents and occasionally his white mother.  His father he didn't know.  Obama admits himself that he thinks himself a black man despite his privilesged and white upbringing and education.<br /><br />White people in this world have their many ethnic groups and languages, customs and cuisines.  But in the black world, the skin color alone seems to give the identity, not old heritage or language families.  Yes, ultimately Isaiah wouldnhave to grow up and see that he is black in a polyglot multiracial world. He would be perceived as black no matter what continent he arrived in.  So he, like Obama, wouldnhave to work out for himself what he would think of himself, if the Jewish Lewin Family kept him.<br /><br />On the other hand, staying with his mother and suffering poverty and ghetto thinking would probably lock his life into a very narrow box.<br /><br />I really did think that some kind of happy end was coming wherein the well off Levin family would take both mother and child into their home, since they needed a nanny anyway.  Then the housing and income questions would be over for the welfare housing mother.  And they would all live happily ever after somehow!  Hum hmmm.  No matter which way this story really would work out in real life, money and the mother's lack of decent work or money would be a major major part of it."

"Certainly One of the best Zorro movies, but is Power the best Zorro?<br /><br />Zorro hardly appears in this film. He displays no swordmanship, little of the fox and only one real getaway. In point of fact, this Zorro is nothing more than a common highwayman. Of course this is not Power's fault, but the fault of the script.<br /><br />So why the five stars?  Because what little Power had to work with regarding Zorro, he more than made up for with Diego.<br />Power may not be the best Zorro, but he IS the best classic Diego at his most foppishness. Eat your heart out, Fairbanks. Power displays a subtle sarcasm and wicked double entendre delivered with imbecilic cluelessness.  Diego also does more, perhaps, then Zorro to rid the publeo of the Alcalde.  After all, the big duel with the Captain is with Diego, NOT Zorro.<br /><br />Overall, a fun movie, not too long and not too short😀. The big duel alone is worth the time."

"Alpha Dog is a good movie, based on the 2000 murder of Nicholas Markowits, it has a number of good actors in it including Anton Yelchin (now deceased) as Zack (Nicholas). Bruce Willis, Sharon Stone and Justin Timberlake just to name a few.... quite a remarkable story.<br />Assault on Precinct 13 is an action movie with Ethan Hawk, a never back down kind of deal. It has Laurence Fishburn, Maria Bello 😍 and Drea DeMatteo 🥰  😁.... and many more. A lot of people don't know that this is a remake of a 1976 John Carpenter movie. I won't ruin in for everyone but people die 🤭🤫"

Like it. But I think Damon Waynes 🤔 is losing his touch on the comedy. It wasn't what I expected. Some scenes were funny but not too pleased with it.

"I'd bought Croods DVD a while ago and watched it so much I decided to get the blue-ray and digital versions so I have several copies. This is the first movie for which I've ever done that. I've introduced the rest of the family to it and sometimes we have it playing on multiple TVs at the same time. It's a totally fun movie! Watch out, you might become addicted to it too.😍"

"I was hesitant to buy the movie Cannibal Women in The Avocado Jungle of Death.<br />Well, at least I don’t feel like I wasted my time.<br />As a teenager I remember watching The Hitchhiker tv show that was featured in an R rated format on HBO.  A vivid episode was seeing Shannon Tweed—not far removed from her Playboy Playmate of The Year award—playing a wicked, very sexy femme fatale.  So, I don’t mind that she keeps her clothes on as the feminist scholar in The Avocado Jungle of Death.  She would be scantily dressed in a bevy of busty, soft porn, straight to cable and video B-movies soon after (Night Eyes 2, Obsession 1,2,3 et cetera, etc).<br />Adrienne Barbeau was well cast as the Col Kurtz ripoff-spoof of Brando from Apocalypse Now.  She starred in Wes Cravens Swamp Thing in 1982.  Barbeau is in the movie for 25 minutes.<br />The other ‘hottie’ (heh, I know…not very politically correct…) on the cover is only on the cover because she, well, looks great in her loin cloth jungle garb.  She has about 2 lines in the movie (and I don’t remember her real name … kinda’ sexist on my part).<br /><br />Cannibal Women is about the ‘agenda’  with Shannon Tweed spewing out her dialogue with just enough intensity and humor to be expected—or needed—for B-movie camp.<br />Bill Maher does the same ‘memory’ of dialogue coherent enough for the logical camp humor.<br />The movie even offers ‘What’s Up Doc?’ Warner Brothers humor when Jim (played by Bill Maher) thinks he’s being given a ‘seasoning’ hot tub bath.  He lifts a carrot out of the steaming water…‘hey, wait a minute.’<br />Anyways,<br />most of the dialogue and feminist agenda references are actually clever and campy and funnier (than the silly Warner Bros joke); and subtle, yet, over the top just like the ridiculous title suggests.<br /><br />This had potential to be a camp classic, right down to how tame it is.  PG rating.  Topless women in beginning the only (naturally) graphic scene.<br />By the way the sword fight scene isn’t about the action of the sword fighting.  It’s about their (so called) banter that’s taking place as the women’s swords touch each other (in defiance of sexist men…a phallic symbol?  Did I read too much into it? I don’t know there was an odd close up of barely moving swords ‘up against’ each other…)<br />Anyways, Cannibal Women in The Avocado Jungle of Death did not waste my time.<br />Tall blonde beautiful Shannon Tweed eventually wears a loin cloth worthy of PG gawking ala Raquel Welch’s prehistoric bikini in One Million Years BC.<br />Nothin’ wrong with dat visual.  Released in 1989 Cannibal Women offers cheap jungle footage in Bakersfield (farming field?).<br />Again, this is about the screenplay by JD Athens (wrote Pretty Woman; Under Siege real name is JF Lawton) and the Piranha Women and their adversary The Barracuda Women who prefer clam dip (does that make them bisexual?  My joke?😅) over avocado dip.<br />3.8 stars.  Wish their was more visual stimulation other than the ‘babes’ (sexist, I know) in jungle dress."

"Emotional yes .. spiritual ummm No !!<br />Here is my review:-<br />1- It touch us as movie , for what this family and this little child went through ..we wept a lot but we couldn't feel that was anything from the Holy Spirit , I've expected (a Christian Movie that give all glory to the lord Jesus) but unfortunately I didn't see that happening.<br />2- I don't like movie with (Hollywood Kissing) there is no need to put them in Christian movies!<br />3- this movies showed that is normal to Christian families that  (they don't pray together , each one pray individual on his bed before go to sleep while they spent all their day playing with smartphones) !!!<br />4- the pastor use to make fun and make his followers to laugh at the church , instead of preaching the word of YESHUA!<br />5- while the child were in emergency room I expected to see the pastor and other church's members praying and crying to the lord , they showed that the pastor was playing a video game with his daughters in the waiting room ??????<br />6-The movie show us how lukewarm was that church ,but no one care to fix that and they were kind of showing to us it is normal to be lukewarm in your faith and careless about others (no one , including the pastor try to help with money or to fly with them or spend some time at the hospital as Jesus want , none of them did that )<br />7- I wished to see the father in his knees while his daughter was dying ...he did everything except praying! He said &#34;I'll work to jobs ,and 7 days a week ..and he sold his motorcycle and ready to sell the house etc ...but never seen him praying, disappointed 😔<br />8-when the Miracle happened, the mother fly back to Boston (Not to share her faith , or to give glory to the lord !!!) she was crying and saying thanks to the doctor and to the nurse ! (Of course she should appreciate what they've done , but she didn't tell them about the lord who heeled her daughter ) disappointing<br />9- the Mom didn't share the good news with the lady who work at the restaurant, although she has chance to do that when she fly back to Boston , they showed she was already good enough , (maybe doesn't need Jesus)!<br />10- the only time (only one as I remember) they've mentioned Jesus name in this movie was when the girl talk to the other child in the hospital !<br />11-worst thing happened in this movie when the mom was talking at the end of the movie she said &#34;Miracles are GOD &#34; ??????????????????? What !<br />It is dangerous to say that especially in this age while we are going to the end  of days , when the devil and false prophets will show miracles and many people will be deceived because of these false Miracles. Miracles aren't God , and also not everyone get miracles, this is false hope .<br />The lord may save you by a miracle and he may not , in both way that doesn't change the fact the Jesus is love and powerful,<br />We fallow him not for miracles , agin miracles and super natural thing could come from false prophets at the end time so don't put your faith in miracles, Jesus is the only God ,not Miracles as the movie climed"

"The acting by every character was incredible. The script was beautifully written. I felt a special fondness for every character. I had wished a sequel could have come about, where time travel could permit continued contact with Charlie and Kate. The sequel could show Stuart marrying the nurse Gretchen who believed in him when no one else did. 🥰"

"Classic movie... every aspect of this film was so well done. The storyline- excellent ! Love the cast (everyone was perfect) the natural scenery is incredible and beautiful, dramatic, emotional... a truly quality movie. 😍 I also like the way the movie was narrated as if recalling a story from the past. Love Berenger's dog in the movie too and the little girl. Great film !"

What I liked about this particular film was the very beginning. Everything from the year and intro too the part where they are hiding from enemy troops passing by. Everything after Guideons escape idea goes down hill. The intro keeps you going but suddenly when they get in the balloon everything gets slow and pointless once at the island. The whole time warp thing was not convincing and the modern day sisters were not necessary.Once Nemo was introduced it got slower and offer. His crew went crazy after being on land so long🤔? Seriously?  Of course it was made 2012 that was a dumb year and they had to make the stupid  Sargent a biggot which wasn't necessary. If you want to watch the WORST film that WASNT BASED on Jule's Book go ahead.

I love these old b&w movies especially anything funny with a touch of spookiness! At first I darn near had a fit when I sat down to watch the movie & up pops that the disc is Region A. I'm like great now I have to return it forgetting I have a Region Free Disc Player 🤣😂! Amazon needs to be more clear about this. Unless I totally missed it I didn't see that the Blu-ray was Region A. It won't play on your Regular Disc Player. It's an entertaining movie & I enjoyed it. There is some racist & sexist material in the movie. If this is an issue with you then don't buy it. I also suggest never watching old shows like The Jeffersons or Archie Bunker..LoL!

"Hope its corolco, not colco. Ill be there soon with cut specifications like in 91. Not 2003 cutting..which is illegal. Much work is required. Further cohesion with decision makers to out rule miscuts of original. For prime copies. Could explode pricing if sales people were specialised in venture capitalism banking. i.e I can increase profits from a single unit sale to highly lucrative interest returns. Again, ill be there soon. Please pause all editing untill finalised for profiting. Thanks. (im only interested in master copies for personal conesiouring on expensive hardware). Happy to help. 🤑🤑🤖🤖🤩🤩🤪😎😎"

"I had this Movie 🎥 on VHS and had to replace it on DVD! The Dy- namic's of the Romance in this Movie are something else! There are a lot of Dynamics going on around them which are interes- ting to say the least!! I know this is an older Movie 🎥 🍿 but, the having Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer I would think you would want to check it out just to see them and there are other Good people too! I would definitely 😁 say ✔️ it out!!!"

"I hear the commentary on the special features can help to shed some light on some of the philosophy stuff, so I fully plan on checking that out, but for now, let's just go with first impressions. First this thing was made by Richard Linklater, who as far as I know usually makes comedies. So this is pretty much the whole other end of the spectrum for him. Because it sure ain't no comedy. I am fully here for it though. And this 💯 percent feels more realative to today than ever. So I would say it's a film that ages pretty darn brilliantly.<br /><br />The animation is nothing short of awesome, and weather you're on drugs or not it's pretty much guaranteed to make you feel like you are. I like it a lot.<br /><br />The story is pretty cool. It's about a guy who is trapped in a waking reccuring dream space, and he can't figure out how to get out of there, so he conjures up various teachers and philosophers to try to help him to better understand his situation.<br /><br />So pretty much the whole thing is just a metaphor for your life.<br /><br />It works on many levels, and begs for multiple viewings and deeper diving. As it is a rapid fire burst of philosophical musings to the head.<br /><br />I have to agree with the other viewer on here, who said it feels almost custom made for the DVD format, since you can use those features to skip around, and skip and or replay the various conversations to suite your current viewing temperament, as you become more or less familiar with the various discourse.<br /><br />Overall it's a very big five stars, and a strong recommendation to anyone who likes to think about stuff."

The second movie came normal and worked fine but the first movie looked like half of it had been peeled off. It was like twice as thin as any other DVD too but somehow it did work 🤷🏽‍♀️. 3 stars bc they both worked but what in the world happened to the first one.

"Pretty good movie. Some parts are REALLY funny. It’s not the most realistic flick, I mean it is Will Ferrell. I wanted to give it five stars because it was a gift for my mom whom I had previously watched it with and she/we enjoyed it thoroughly! She was quite happy to receive it as a gift and I have already pre-ordered the sequel, which is similarly redicilous with some quite humorous parts! Check it out!<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because while it is enjoyable, I don’t think it’s quite there. 4 Star as a movie, 5 Star as a gift for someone who is a fan and doesn’t currently own it! By the way, if you have Amazon Prime, I think you can stream it right now for free. So if you’re not sure if you want to own a hard copy, go stream it first and check it out! 😀"

"I will preface this by saying this: of you don't like subtitles, this may not be a movie for you. From what I read and my own experience with the anti-subtitle population is that movie like this one tend to be slow. However, if you are feeling froggy, then make the leap and watch this movie.<br /><br />So i watched this on Netflix tonight while I was bored. I didn't expect much, but I do love foreign films so I figured why not? Well I am happy I watched this.<br /><br />I love watching the growth of the characters especially the main protagonist. She. Kicks. Ass. But the movie reminds you that she is young and through in some really great moments that just make you fall in love with her.<br /><br />The story. Wow. Where do I start? Well it evolves so whatever you think is going on probably isn't. When you see/hear/read the plot twist, your jaw will drop. Truly a beautiful story with great fight scenes. My favorite has to be the last &#34;battle&#34;. It was EPIC!<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away hence why my review is rather vague. If you like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon...you will like this movie.<br /><br />I just bought a copy after I finished it on Netflix. 🎉"

"It's not a children's movie per say...it's not like putting on Barney or Barbie....I see it as more like a teenager/young adult movie, for the simple fact that for a PG film, it has quite a bit of violence and death. Besides young children wouldn't understand such strong adult thematic events, I mean it would be awkward having to explain something like this to a child. I don't know exactly why I like this movie, there's a magnetic pull, that attracts me to it. I was 8 years old when my mom bought the vhs for me back in '95 and I loved it!! I'm now 27 and I still haven't changed. I still love it, the only difference now that I'm older is, I understand it, which makes me love it even more. It can't be easy to practically be human in an animals body, experiencing human emotions such as love, sadness, happiness, hate, anger, jealousy, and regret....in a way it's a complicating story @ the same time, it's not. There are a lot of different themes here, learn to love your family and be there for them everyday, learn to be happy with who you are or what you are, don't judge a book by its cover, and learn to appreciate and love life, the way an animal does. I suppose that it can be a little disturbing to feel love and desire for a woman(his human wife @ one point) as a dog, in fact almost perverted, but then again this is no ordinary dog. As a dog it is impossible to assume the role of a male human to care for a human family...so he reluctantly leaves the job to his best friend, Jeff to care for them in the end. It's also possible for a soul to continually reincarnate like rumbo(another dog) in the beginning for example, as he is reborn again as a squirrel in the end. It is a strange form of immortality, but there you go. It's one of those films, where you'll never look @ your pet the same way again, especially a dog...one of the other things I love about this film, is the orchestra composition, the music is beautiful in my opinion, and I downloaded some tracks on my phone, which I enjoy listening to, and makes me think about fluke. Anyway, the beginning is kind of cute with the pups, and ridiculous in terms of the humor, I personally thought the film got better, when he journeys to his home town Hopewell. But without the beginning, you wouldn't know the end. 😉 so if you like dogs, me I love dogs, and you like a lot of drama, you will like this...probably. Thank you!"
"4 stars bc the shipping was super fast & I love this movie! However, the picture is a little fuzzy, but I guess that is to be expected with an older filmed not on Blu-Ray! Oh well, still enjoyed watching 😊"
"Movie arrived safely. Adding this to my library. Have always enjoyed it, now I can watch it whenever I want! 😃"

"Tom Holland is such a great spider man. Toby Mcguire was a good Peter Parker, but a meh spider man (where mah quips at?!) And then Andrew Garfield was a great quippy spider man, but nowhere near nerdy enough as Peter Parker (he was too cool, I don't buy it). Tom Holland is perfect at both! Little nerd who talks too much 🥰 Flawless"

I love this movie and I was so excited to watch it with my little boy but it was damaged and the last half of the movie would not play. I tried to contact someone about it but there isn't an option to contact seller anywhere. Very disappointed 😒

"Everyone in this movie is fine EXCEPT for Jay Baruchel - he's a terrible live action leading man. Annoying, sarcastic, and nebbish.<br /><br />As for the movie, my boys liked it (8 & 10yo). The effects were good, Nick Cage was fun, and there was just enough plot to fill 90mins. Probably wouldn't watch it again though. 😕"

"The Japanese [[ASIN:B00L3ZB7JO Eraserhead]]?<br />Shin'ya Tsukamoto's decision to film in black and white was only one of many artistic choices culminating in a cult classic that still holds up over 25 years later. Unlike mediocre movies, it has the potential to haunt you a full two decades after watching it; you may not remember less important aspects such as plot, but you will certainly remember the transformation of Tetsuo. Long before Hollywood's Transformer or Iron Man flicks became mainstays at the multiplex, Tetsuo was both Iron Man and a Transformer.<br />👹<br />Tetsuo would work well as a silent film but for the fact that the soundtrack and audio effects are part of what makes The Iron Man so stunning. This was created in the relatively early days of Industrial music (e.g., Einstürzende Neubauten), and while nothing special today, it was very memorable in 1990. One can imagine how painstaking it must have been to do all of the stop motion animation in this work of art; it's doubtful that directors / producers would put in this much work today, given CGI.<br />👺<br />Beyond expectations, Body Hammer is a worthy sequel. Although I ordered this double feature Blu-ray from Amazon's UK site (since it cost about half the asking price on this site), it looks like prices here have dropped to below $20, which reasonable for a cult flick. Just be aware it's Region B: not the US standard for playback."

"I read the BOOK. I have it on Blue- Ray as a gift for my spouse by mistake  and I need to buy DVD, but I do not want a junky copy or too expensive copy. If you think this movie is great, cool, fantastic, one of the best 🎬 movies, you will love Beneker Gang. It is starring Andrew McCarthy,  and the little kid from Who's  the Boss? Try to see this movie. and read the book also. Yo will not be disappointed.  These were the days of innocent  youth, and when kids helped parents in their struggles...............................................Don't  sleep on this movie."

"“Go Flash Go!”<br />“I love you Flash…! But we only have 24 hours to save Earth.”<br />Dale Arden spews out these cheesy gems and 40 years ago I did not appreciate the camp intentions of the dialogue as much as I did in 2022.  Campy cheesy gold.<br />I also find the fake yet wondrous colors of planet Mongo’s sky a uniquely memorable plus that cues the soundtrack by Queen:<br />“Fflashh!  Ah ahh/Master of the universe!”<br /><br />And watch as fu Manchu costumed Max Von Sydow — as Ming the Merciless — delights in the torture of his own flesh and blood.  Merciless indeed.<br />Ornella Muti was already an Italian sensation when Flash Gordon was released.  No wonder.  She is practically too sexy for PG; a pure hot blooded seductress purring in tight leather.<br />Timothy Dalton is a Robin Hood looking potential hero but … well he might come around.  He is jealous and suspicious for good reason.  He’s got Ming to worry about, a very fickle girlfriend (to put it mildly) and these earthling characters showing up claiming some pretty outrage stuff.  Why help them?<br />Topol (he definitely gets the joke too) is the semi mad scientist who tricks the simple all American Flash Gordon (Sam J Jones) to go to Mongo.  Melody Anderson gamely portrays Dale Arden doing what she can with the script.  Don’t take it seriously while remaining likable.<br />It all makes for an entertaining, campy, visually fluid and fun ride.<br />And I didn’t even mention the Hawkman and his minions and Ming’s rather exuberant assistants enjoying their work way too much.<br />Flash Gordon is so original with its camp flavor it even has a slight Rocky Horror Picture Show feel to it.  Not surprisingly Richard O’Brien pops up in a small part alongside Dalton.<br />Really fun to see Flash go Flash go…again!<br />4 easy going stars racing to save Earth!<br /><br />Oh extras good also.  Writer Lorenzo Semple confirms he knew he had to “write this as a comedy…”.  Artist Alex Ross admits he saw Flash 100 times and it influenced his art immensely.<br />Checkout the 1936 serial too.  The bad dialogue and some mediocre acting all seem to confirm why this 1980 redo was made with tongue firm-in-the-cheek😉"
So well made! This movie should have gotten an Academy Award for Best Wardrobe. 👍

I had been looking through the reviews before I ordered it and I saw a poster that came with it in one of them. I ordered it and I was excited to put the poster on my wall but unfortunately it didn’t come with a poster. It kinda made me sad tbh but overall the condition is great and the movie is excellent. Jus really bummed I didn’t get a poster. 😭

"I normally don't take the time to write too many reviews, but after reading so many negative(and unnecessarily warranted) comments, I felt the need to try and balance the scales a little here.<br /><br />""Worst movie ever produced"", ""Worst pile of trash I've ever seen""? The worst EVER... really? Yeesh... lighten up, people! If this is the worst movie you've ever seen, then you haven't seen many movies in your life. I can name 100 movies that are worse than this one. I even question if some of these reviewers have even watched the previous ""Predator"" flicks. What were all the haters expecting this movie to be? It's not like it misled moviegoers. All the ""crude humor"" and ""tasteless violence"" was even highlighted in the trailers before it was released. Plus, were the original Predator movies really THAT great? They consisted of everything this movie did... offensive jokes, violence, gore, you name it! Am I the only one who remembers all the vagina jokes in the first movie? You know, the movie that all these fanboys hold so dear, and detest the humor in this movie for. They're all just mindless, yet really fun action/sci-fi flicks, and that is why us REAL fans keep coming back for more. They're just plain FUN! I swear, I think ""fun"" might just be a four-letter-word these days.<br /><br />I also really love the reviews that constantly mention that this movie is just another crap-fest in a long line of horrible Predator sequels. Hey, I've got an idea, if you don't like Predator movies, then, uhmm... QUIT WATCHING THEM! It's as simple as that. But, if you haters just want to keep torturing yourselves, then go ahead and keep on keepin' on. Just quit trying to use your unpleasantness to drag a decent movie through the mud... oh, wait, maybe if you do drag it through the mud, then maybe your PREDATOR EYES won't see it. Ha-ha, SEE what I did there? 😉<br /><br />Anyway... I personally thought that this movie gave me everything I was expecting (and wanted) from a new Predator flick. Nothing less, nothing more. For me, it's just pure escapism for a mind that's burned-out on all of the crap that's currently going on in the world today.<br /><br />So, if you can actually enjoy a movie for what it's worth, and quit comparing it to something it's not, then you might actually enjoy it.<br /><br />It had great action, great monsters, great FX, great dialogue with a great cast to deliver it... recommended! 👍"

I don't understand why this wasn't released on dvd after being avertised that it would be.. Only Bluray and digital. I can't see buying a Bluray player to watch one movie when I have 2 perfectly good dvd players, either! I tried contacting numerous people involved with the making of the film, including Amazon Studios and have gotten no where! Why??? PLEASE, RELEASE SUSPIRIA 2018 ON DVD! 😭😭😭"

"Very disappointed!  We have ordered some of our favorite movies in Blu-ray.  We just had a chance to watch this and the audio is not in sync with the video😡.  It is to late to exchange.  I think I will find a different place to order movies.  I have received at least 5 different movies with various problems.  From Movies made for use only in the UK, to it beginning with a completely different movie then switching to the actual movie I ordered.  Maybe amazon needs to check the sellers they use more thoroughly."

"If you love Will Farrell or the movie itself the Rich Mahogany version is a must buy. Classic comedy, love the movie, and the rich mahogany version is awesome. More content than I could ever ask for on disc and the journal and playing cards are really cool are as a novelty and collectors item. To the guy complaining he didn't get the cards there is an extra compartment in the sleeve that contains the journal and cards. I almost missed it myself but you can tell the sleeve is to heavy to not have anything in it. Well worth the current price and this is an edition is a set that I'd would gladly even pay up to $20. Remember, Stay Classy 😜"

"Came in good condition, dvd was good, good movie overall👍"
"Came in good condition, dvd was good, good movie overall👍"
"Early on in the movie, after a mysterious ball of ice is found in the freezing Baring Sea, we hear the ship's captain say, &#34;Is that a man in there, or something?&#34; Right then and there I understood the director's fascination with the 1982 version of &#34;The Thing&#34;. A little while later we hear the ships only African-American male  ranting about not believing in this &#34;voodoo bulls***&#34;, also directly taken from &#34;The Thing&#34;! Is this bad? Absolutely not! I had tons of fun with this low budget sci-fi thriller! The obvious is there. Accept and enjoy! Although it's really not frightening, it is fun to watch, and the effects are not that bad either. People have compared it to &#34;Leviathan&#34;, &#34;Alien&#34;, and of course &#34;The Thing&#34;. &#34;The Thing&#34; I can see, but it's really nothing like &#34;Alien&#34; which Ridley Scott ripped off from &#34;It! The Terror From Beyond Space&#34;, so what's the beef? LOL The plot surely borrows from &#34;The Thing&#34;, but I love those movies, and really didn't mind at all! MacCready's Chess Wizard even makes an appearance as if that isn't obvious enough, but ohhhh, what fun indeed! Even the characters are well rounded out, and the acting is not too shabby with Lance Henriksen at the helm!<br />The effects seem to lean more toward stop-motion animation, but that makes it even more cool! Chris Drake's score is hauntingly ambient, and at times actually sounds very Moriconesque! This movie was worth every penny ($12) I paid, and is great to have in your collection if you love this type of sci-fi/horror. I highly recommend it, so go out, buy it and enjoy the schlock! 👹"

Great Action Packed Movie but whatever you do never buy this movie at Wal-Mart they are not selling the digital copy with the blu ray 👺👹👺👹. You have to pay more money and buy this 4k version if you really need a code. Never buy the blu ray at Wal-Mart you will be disappointed

"Hello I  received my package 📦 wonderful.  But my Blu-ray disc won't play its stuck on the main screen.  Funny I just got finished watching another Blu-ray and it's not my equipment. I would like to have my CD replaced please.  With one that works please let me know where to send this one back to all I'm hearing on here is 1 song, and it's not even a whole song at that.<br />Very unpleased."
Better to buy the DVD than pay per view at a higher cost. 🧐.

This movie is hilarious and I am so glad I have it! It was packaged well and not damaged at all by handling which is great! Getting it for a deal was definitely a plus! My favorite scene is definitely the lemmons 😂 definitely a great buy if you haven’t seen this movie before. It’s a bit raunchy and there’s is drug use in the film so it isn’t suitable for children but a mature teenager shouldn’t have any issue watching this film but below 16 I would caution. It is a hilarious and very well done movie for adults!!

"A movie I grew up on that I'll never forget. I would be willing to do what the man in this story has done, even if it meant my life. This film is about a man determined to not see the wrong animals die for wrong reasons, and yet here we are 30 years later with wolves being an endangered species... Again. We are failing this world because we are failing ourselves for greed. Such is life. The wolves were here before humans and they'll be here after us. 🐺💯💙"

Love the movie! The company however....😡😡 no where did it tell me that I needed to have a European DVD player. I was unaware of it until I opened it and tried to return it. After being told I could return it. They changed their story and because it wasn’t in the wrapping anymore I couldn’t return it for a refund. 😡😡
"So glad I finally got this movie, it’s so cheesy it makes you want to see it over and over agin 🤣🤣🤣"

"Minor spoilers will be said in this review so...<br /><br />This has become one of my new favorite movies ansd I don't even like drama films much. To me this movie is like a black comedy and always makes me laugh because of the dialogue and the way the lines are delivered (courtesy of Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts' amazing performances). Each character is funny and I like the Oklahoma plains setting because I'm very country. The bluray looks amazing. Each time the camera shifts to reveal background scenery of thr plains, tree's and the lake abd even the towns my eyes are always glued to the screen in awe.<br /><br />The story is pretty simple. A family crisis happens bringing every family member back together, a family that was pretty dysfunctional in the past but are otherwise able to get by (under the best of circumstances... --Ewan McGregor). As the film goes by we learn about each character and their problems and watch as the family completely breaks apart in the end. It sounds depressing but its actually entertaining and funny. From characters like Karen who is not willing to accept reality and be forced to be believed that her new husband is perfect to Little Charles (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) who is a social screw up who shares a relationship with his &#34;cousin&#34; Ivy, the stories are engaging and you'll be left wondering what happens afterwards to these characters in the end. You'll even be wondering how their problems will be resolved while watching. The 14 year old girl Jean, played by Abigail Breslin to my surprise is the SAME little girl from Signs! How she's grown!<br /><br />One thing I want to point out, not criticizing the story in general, but of the character Ivy. Her relationship with Little Charles is supposed to be kept a secret...YET she does an awfully horrible job trying to hide it! Examples are when she tries kissing him outside out in the open where someone could have easily been eavesdropping. Second and third is at the infamous &#34;dinner scene&#34; when he blurts out &#34;I have a confession&#34; causing her to feverishly plead &#34;No Charles, not like this.&#34; If that didn't give anything away that there's at least something going on between those two then I don't know what. But it doesnt end there. In the same scene immediately following it when he runs out excusing himself, his mother Maddy Faye criticizes him as usual calling him Little Charles, having Ivy reply &#34;(sniff) Charles. (sniff, sob) His name is Charles.&#34;<br />I mean...she really did not try to keep their relationship a secret. That's the only gripe I have with her character.<br /><br />This movie to me is like one of those nice little getaways, meaning its a movie I'll enjoy seeing anytime or if I'm preoccupied with home projects or work I'll have this playing in the background. Watch this movie if you haven't and watch it in Bluray HD for the best viewing. It's really entertaining and its sure to bring some laughs to the table.<br /><br />&#34;Now don't f***ing cut ice with me! Eat the f***ing fish!!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;I'm not hungry!&#34;<br /><br />ROFL...😃😂😂<br />&#34;Eat the fish b**ch!&#34;"

Perfect! How can I say anymore except the shipper even sent a personal note expressing the wish that the DVD met my expectations. It did and arrived about 2 weeks earlier than the end of the window. Great! 😋

Had seen previously a few yrs back on netflix as it's a netflix exclusive movie. Moved 4 years ago and no netflix or internet. Had looked for this movie elsewhere with no luck and recently came across it here on amazon and had to order it. A must see eye opener movie for the whole family. 🌱❤

"I mean this is a must buy for any horror movie fan. It’s got that old school feel to it but it’s a great movie. It’s in my opinion one of the most underrated horror films. The movie came in the plastic so I assume they are all new. The art on the cover is badass, the movie is really good and it is a must buy. 🎃🌽"

"This movie was a huge no for me at first as it is mostly in Spanish, but after thinking about it, I gave it another try. Lot of reading sub titles but this was a great movie with a shock twist ending. I would encourage those who rejected it to give it a 2nd chance. The main point to the movie will be made and I bet you need tissues at the end! 😭😭"

"The picture doesn’t even justify the damage to this disc, it has TONS of scratches and wear. I definitely feel lied to; the product was described as in “Very Good” condition, this was certainly not the case with this product. One of the worst purchases I’ve made, I’m not sure if I can trust Decluttr (the vendor I bought it from) again. 👎🏻"

"Overall this film portrayed native americans in the same stereotypical ways. As if they all have broken, abusive families, eat fried bread, and are uneducated. I should've known that half of the time when a movie has a high rating on Amazon it's really actually trash😖.Not to mention another great downside is.... Adam Beach's hair. It was fine at the beginning of the film, you know he's a cute guy, but then he cut it. But not fully?!?!? 😣So he looks like a girl ?!?!?That made no sense at all. And his mother didn't say anything at all when he returned home, which was very unrealistic as to how a mother would react to any change in her child. In various cultures a sign of mourning or upset is signified with shaving one's head or cutting one's hair,  but that was not at all portrayed properly. It should've been cut much shorter than that !!!"

"4️⃣ Four Twilight Zone-style tales by Lafcadio Hearn, told as an anthology, with Japanese style, grace, symbolism, and high production values. Now TZ could have dropped all the artistic content and made it through these stories in 30 minutes each, with commercials. But this movie takes a more artistic and more rewarding approach. And since the stories are separate, there are built-in breakpoints. Clearly an influence on Paul Schrader's great ""Mishima."" Cinematography, lighting, and color are all splendid.  It's 183 minutes, almost as long as ""Cleopatra"" from the year before, and about ten times better.<br />1. Black Hair 💁🏻‍♀️<br />A samurai deserts his wife for a lucrative job, and finds out he can't go home again.<br />2. The Woman of the Snow ❄️<br />Two woodcutters are freezing in a blizzard, when they meet the woman, with uncanny results.<br />3. Hoichi the Earless 👂<br />Blind Hoichi spends every night away from the temple where he works. Why? Some things man was not meant to know.

"4️⃣ Four Twilight Zone-style tales by Lafcadio Hearn, told as an anthology, with Japanese style, grace, symbolism, and high production values. Now TZ could have dropped all the artistic content and made it through these stories in 30 minutes each, with commercials. But this movie takes a more artistic and more rewarding approach. And since the stories are separate, there are built-in breakpoints. Clearly an influence on Paul Schrader's great ""Mishima."" Cinematography, lighting, and color are all splendid.  It's 183 minutes, almost as long as ""Cleopatra"" from the year before, and about ten times better.<br />1. Black Hair 💁🏻‍♀️<br />A samurai deserts his wife for a lucrative job, and finds out he can't go home again.<br />2. The Woman of the Snow ❄️<br />Two woodcutters are freezing in a blizzard, when they meet the woman, with uncanny results.<br />3. Hoichi the Earless 👂<br />Blind Hoichi spends every night away from the temple where he works. Why? Some things man was not meant to know. Perhaps marred by the comedy relief of the two bumbling doofuses.<br />4. In a Cup of Tea 🍵<br />A mystery wrapped in a riddle, and neither one is solved. But if you see the reflection of a smiling young man in your drink, and there's no one there, try to be polite and respectful, won't you? You might meet again—in the Kwaidan Zone!"

What a lovely 4K blu ray 🙄 completely corrupted. Won’t play at all. I guess this is the kind of quality control you can expect when everyone stops caring about physical media. Complete waste of money 😪

Great cast and a good movie 🎦.looks great on blu ray.
Love this movie. Annoyed it did not say it needed a European DVD player to watch it so I have to get one 😡😡😡. A year later and still haven't gotten to watch it. Glad I have a bunch of streaming services. Guess I'll just sell my copy I got from here.

The dvds a great but unfortunately the case is garbage. The dvds fall out of their holders and the center page that holds two dvds broke within a week. I love that they offer all of the dvds as a set just wish they didn’t cheap out on the packaging. I recommend buying this and some separate dvd cases to hold them in. Throw original case out 👍🏻

I liked the idea of a evil super hero. A child too. Those are two things that are not supposed to be 😨 scary. Definitely a very good film. Very bloody though. It makes the child even more intimidating. Which didn't seem possible. Worth watching

Sorry I bought this.  My memory was better than the movie.  Take out the profanity - all unneeded - and I'll give it another star.  Maybe.  Robin Wiiliams AND John Travolta were both super annoying and iveracted their parts.  Next time I'll be more certain to bet on Rotten Tomatoes = 5% - not on Amazon!  😡

I saw this in the opening friday for the first time. I went 6 times more to get every detail. This is the strongest war movie I have ever seen. It shows the good and the evil from a period of history that should never be repeated.<br />Strange how I like to see it in Better quality🤷🏼‍♂️🤔

Make sure to check all the disks when you get them. The 4k disk is what we paid the extra money for. It’s the disk that did not work. 🤦🏻‍♀️

Arrived on time as normal but only had 3 of the movies shown in the case. “Dave” didn’t make it into the box. 🤦🏻‍♂️<br />Update Dave shares an untitled disc that has a movie on each side.

OMG!! I loved it. Mary Poppins Returns was practically perfect in every way.😍
Loved everything about it. Watched it with my 4 grandchildren 😊
Loved the new rendition of the movie! The animation is fabulous! Saw it on the Big Screen twice and streamed it at home. Now buying the DVD for a friend to enjoy. (It was great seeing Dick Van Dyke acting in this new version too!) This movie brings back many fine memories. 🙂
The best of film noir. Get it! 🎄😍

"I could never pick a number one favorite movie my whole life....til now. This movie is so moving and so beautiful. It may not have won the academy award for best picture but it wins best picture in my heart and on the top of my list of all time favorites. It is a movie for movie lovers. The music is genius and gets stuck in your head, in a good way, and the chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is perfect 💯"

A laugh a minute great movie 🎥 original story excellent casting/acting ~ also a one in rare occasion that a Blu-ray TM disc had a consistently high quality picture clarity of 31 ~ 34 MegaBitsPerSecond! It is very rare that I agree with Amazons star ⭐️ rating!

"I'm a puppeteer by trade and even though this movie made like 5 cents in the theaters, I was looking forward to the DVD release... I love extra features on DVDs and this one has plenty. I enjoyed the story and it was a great idea; the public wasn't ready for this movie,that's all.  I enjoyed it myself-nothing funnier than an octopus milking all the udders of a cow simultaneously...🐴anyway thanks for the convenience of having it available and I'll see you guys around."

I gave this movie one star instead of 5 because this is one of the worst movie I ever seen in my life.  Are these people real actors or what? Oh my goodness I wish I had time to point out every bad scene in this movie but I don’t have time. Just know this whole entire movie is horrible. There is not one scene in this movie was good.  There was not one actor in this movie could act.  What a waste of time.  I give this movie one big fat F.<br /><br />signed:  Please don’t waste your time. 🤦‍♀️

"I really can't rate this one. I didn't see that it was unable to play in the us region when I bought it. So I paid 3.99 for shipping to you, and 10.00  shipping to the uk company to send it back. I got back 5.71 . I was left with -15.00 in the hole, and no movie. I'll make sure any movie I get next time it USA compatible .😢"

"WOW. I’m blown away by AnnaLynne’s performance!!! This woman can ACT. ‘Tracy Lords’ was SUPERB in her role as well! I found this film in a thrift store and took a chance:) Never heard of AnnaLynne until tonight.  Immediately upon finishing film I looked up her other films on Amazon and ordered two of them lol🤗 Aside from my new fascination with her, this movie had me riveted from the moment it began. Was one hell of an interesting concept, completely original, fascinating, dark, humorous & somewhat quirky. I’ll definitely be rewatching this film and am exceptionally happy I own it👌🏽"

"Dr. Cyclops is a great film for fans and collectors of early sci-fi on blu-ray. An absolutely fantastic job was done on this Kino Lorber issue. Color is exactly what Technicolor intended it to be. Its such a beautiful crisp picture and a fun ride on a crazy excursion into the Jungle, help out a mad scientist and get subjected to his evil intents. Brilliant 1940's cinema and a thrill to experience it like never before. In beautiful 1080p. 👍👍👍👍👍<br />✌❤🙂"

"I remember in like I think 1997, just seeing the slide pictures scene as a little kid before I thankfully left the room and that's it. Then in 2002, obviously on the 10th anniversary, on tv, I catch a scene from when female character was released from jail, slide pictures happened and reminded me of the 90s and BREAK!!!!!!!... That got me into my couch. If I caught that scene all the way from 1997, I would've ran out of the living room and have a hard time to go to the bathroom. Lol. Anyway, became a fan of it ever since. I fully watched most of it later on and 100% more after that and still happy to have it in my collection. Bloody Mary was pretty easy enough for me to say at the mirror. But, Candyman... I can't remember ever finishing it at mirror. Lol. Clive Barker, the man who brought us Hellraiser wrote this as a short story called THE FORBIDDEN! I listened to it on audio and boy... What a story! The movie is 50% different. But, that's okay. Besides,  it started out as a short story. So, if you want to get chills by a supernatural movie like IT, any of the ITs you seen, I recommend the 1992's CANDYMAN. He is the 2nd scariest Horror Villain in my top ten 🥤😳🍿"

"Another movie I originally saw scenes from while watching Terror in the Aisles. Nobody seemed to know what it was. I found out by accident (watching extras on the Fatal Attraction dvd) but couldn't find a copy. To my surprise, it was here for less than $10, complete with extras! This lady was crazy! If you're into these types of movies, I'd highly recommend it!👍👍"

I don’t understand why some reviewers say it’s not funny 😳-this movie IS FUNNY!!! Haha has some quirky lines and moments but I feel it fits the characters good! And was a well done movie and full of laughs 😆 ..unless your someone with a very dry sense of humor- watch it!

"I have seen this movie too many times to count.  It is one of the funniest movies I’ve ever seen.  I’ve given everyone I love a copy and told them to pass it on.  This movie is at least 20 years old so some of the political correctness is in the wind.<br />There is no better favor you can do for yourself and those you love, you must buy this movie.<br />But it now and laugh till the cows come home😂"

"There's not a chance in Hades that I would read the books, but I was willing to sacrifice 104 minutes in front of the screen for the following reasons:<br />🌙 Since [[ASIN:B0002XP01O The Hunger]] (1983), I've made a point of watching every vampire film released (I don't claim to have seen them all, but I've watched as many as I can handle)<br />🌙 A 21st century vampire movie with no werewolves! Thank the gods! See kids? It can be done.<br />🌙 The fetching Zoey Deutch, who's sort of a hybrid between Ellen Page and a young Lisa Sheridan (I adore both, so I'm now a Zoey fanboy too)<br /><br />Really there's no need to write a review since over 700 are already written here, BUT in case someone does a keyword search for [[ASIN:B0046XG48O Buffy]], they might find this one. Those of us who have seen all 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer will be happy to point out to today's youth that Vampire Academy borrowed heavily from it, most apparently in the category of humor... and that's fine by me, because I quite miss Buffy.<br />Humor via Zoey Deutch is precisely what keeps Vampire Academy from being a terrible movie, but alas, VA was a box office bomb and the idea for a sequel is officially nixed (Budget: $30 million, Box office: $15.4 million. Ouch!)<br />I guess to do a successful vamp film these days you need to drop a helpless creature like Bella Swan (and then her possessive stalker) onto the screen with werewolves, and that's just a pity."

"I bought this to blend with a few other essential oils, but find I love the smell so much just by itself... I do mix it with a Carrier oil (grapeseed oil) that has no smell.  It seems to be working great on my fine lines around my eyes & helping to tighten my neck back up some... At 58 I need all the help I can get... Lol 😩 Love this stuff💖"

The disc itself seems fine but I'm very perturbed that it never mentioned Before I bought it that it's geared toward region 2...I am in region 1😠. I tried some hacking tips to change my region but they didn't work so now I have a totally useless DVD 🙄💩. It's ridiculous! I would have to buy a new player just to watch it.

"This is one of the greatest movies in cinematic history. The behind the scenes is a great addition to this DVD that will answer all the questions Howard the duck fans are dying to know. This movie was definitely a stepping stone for Tim Robbins for his portrayal of Andy Dufresne in ""Shawshank Redemption"" as well as for Jeffrey Jones as principal Ed Rooney in ""Ferris Buhler's day Off""<br />10/10<br />5 🌟<br />Highly recommend!"

Just a helpful hint before you send your copy: Many of the long pictures (3hrs. or more) especially in the 50s-60s had an 'Overture' of music and themes from the film...3-5 minutes before the start of the film with the curtains closed..(no picture) so audience could hurry up and get seated. No previews or trailers with THESE films.<br />They also had a 10-15 minute Intermission half to 3/4 way through the film....also with music. Many restored bluray discs now contain all of these. Be assured there was absolutely nothing wrong with your disc.😉

Thank You Amazon For “Elena Undone” Lesbian DVD. I Love It. XXXOOO 😀😇😍😘🙏✝️❤️✡️💕🕎💋💍👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩✌️🖖👍🇺🇸🇮🇱🏳️‍🌈💥
Such an excellent film. Most lesbian films focus too much on the sex and not the love and romance. So happy to find another movie to add to my library. 😊❤

A Great Movie! Taraji P. Henson was excellent in this movie. The entire cast was great...they  really portrayed the real lives of their characters and the events leading up to the now history making real life ending. This is how you film a biography. If by chance you haven't seen this 🎥 movie... Make haste..it's a must see!

"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is Wakaliwood action. If you don't immediately know what that means, just watch it and see 👀<br /><br />You're getting two hilarious/action packed films created by people who actually care about films. And make them using everything and anything at their disposal. It's like that movie Jack Black and Mos Def made a few years ago. Except its actually good."

"I ordered 4 DVDs. Two worked, 2 sucked pond water. This is second pond water review. I bragged about this movie to niece and made Toy Story snacks and pulled out my son's old Toy Story's dolls.. ready, set 😧woe! Didn't work. We tried everything but no cooperation. With this 3 yr old crying, devastated, wish you had live customer service again cause I would have called. Luckily I remembered a few scenes (?! two actually) and we acted them out and that stopped the tears and one smile.  You owe me Amazon"

"The preview looked like this would be an awesome movie 🎥 but it fell really short for me‼️ I was ready for a cute love story but that's not the case. She is a very selfish and inconsiderate girl‼️😕 She takes off and doesn't even tell her parents where she went, then, a boy who has a crush on her feels like he needs to be the one to find her‼️ I'm not going to say anything else in case you still want to see it."

"I'm glad Nat Wolff's performance is great and Cara Delevigne is amazing. Everything about the movie great. When it comes to the ending well 😤 It made angry. The movie is great but if feels like romance but with little to pay off for the main character Quintin, it that's only problem with this movie ending. I didn't read the novel but I was hoping that Quintin's journey to good and states the mission but the power of friendship became the centerpiece. Again I was expecting more romance, not a yugioh episode or Kamen Rider Fourze. Overall I still liked it"

The little girl is just too adorable and I loved every minute while watching this - made me bawl my eyes out too! I even tried the suggestion and found 3 people & helped them out - hope they did the same :)<br />Love the soundtrack ❤ 😍"

"When I first saw this film, I thought it was the weaker of the three in this series. But, I bought it anyway. I'm  glad I did. This is great fun. The characters are diverse and well defined. There is humor, as in the other two. Chris Pine and Simon Pegg are the stand-outs in this film. Basically, it just great fun and I will watch it many times over🙌🙌🙌"

"As I reviewed on iMDB based on others' reviews, I don't get all the negativity around this!! Is it as good as the live musical?? Of course not, but it won't be, this is an F-I-L-M. I loved it and LOVE the hybrid CGI look they created between human & feline features (ears that perk when they're talking/singing??!! HELLOOOO 😃) The lead female from The Royal Ballet is phenomenal, as is her Ladyship Judi Dench...For cat lovers worldwide, get ready for some tummy-rubbin whisker-ticklin cream-slurpin good times!! 😻😹"

A different spin on horror 🍿 I ❤️ the storyline and I was actually scared and ordered the movie 🎥 for my sister.  It’s not a long movie and you don’t have to spend time trying to figure out the plot.  The ending was sad to me and I wished I had viewed it at the movie theatre.  Refreshing and good 😊 actors.

"We like John Wayne movies, they are always great. As far as a Man Called Horse, we watched all of it. Was not our taste, storyline did not make sence. That's why we gave it 4 🌟"

This is a great movie telling the story of one of the biggest groups in the history of Rap music. The blu-ray is the unrated director's cut with 20 extra minutes and the DVD is the theatrical version of the movie.<br />A 5 🌟 movie.

"A psychological horror movie that reminds you to remember the REAL monsters out there. A year before my future child is ready for driving, this will be a good movie to watch for them 😂"

"Fantastic movie!<br /> No surprise comming from Clint Eastwood.<br />A wonderful Testament of the life and story behind Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and the trials and tribulations, the ups and downs in and around the musoc business back in the day, the disc jockeys the recording studios if the day. But most of all if you love Doo-Wop music and the legendary sound of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and his string of hits? This movie is for you. A must have! Its rocking, heart worming, and powerful! AWESOME! 🎶👍"

Stone Cold released in 1991 is a awesome movie. Staring Brian Bosworth in his acting debut. Bosworth plays Joe Huff a Alabama cop who goes undercover for the FBI as John Stone. To take down Chains Cooper played by Lance Henriksen the president of a outlaw motorcycle club. Also staring William Forsythe.<br />Stone Cold is nonstop action thrill ride. 5 🌟<br />This is the 2007 DVD edition that includes both widescreen and full screen versions of the movie that I have pictured here.

"What a thrill it must have been (1940's) to go to the theater to watch a new chapter of a super hero series. I own 4 of the classics Capt America 🇺🇸, (Capt Marvel)SHA⚡ ZAM, and both of the Batman 🦇 serials and I'm looking at more. I've always had one disappointment with the Capt.America series and that was the absence of a shield for Cap. Love the fight 👊💢😫 scenes,full of energy."

My 3 year old saw the advertising for King Kong scull island and begged to watch it, thanks prime!🤨 I remembered this movie from years back and ordered it immediately. He believes he got to see King Kong and I only paid $4, bonus, no nightmares!"

"Best movie made of Elvis’ life. Did you know that Kurt Russel’s first roll was in the Elvis movie “ It Happened at the World’s Fair”? Elvis pays the boy a quarter to kick him in the shin so he could get some help from a pretty nurse at clinic located at the fair.<br />Kurt does a marvelous job as Elvis in this movie. Really it is they best one and remains the best today!! A must see for all Elvis fans!<br />I’m an avid fan of Elvis Presley. I grew up on Elvis movies and music. My mother use to buy all of his music as soon as it would come out on record. Yes, I said records! Hey, it was the sixties! Every time a new Elvis movie would come to the drive-in theatre we would pick up a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken and head for the theatre. But this was about noon or so. Seriously, we had to go sit in our car for hours waiting for them to open. If you wanted to actually see the movie you had to go that early. They really packed them in. Many people would go, even if they didn’t have a speaker. We had to do that once. We parked along the side driveway and take a blanket to lay out on the grass up front where they also had a playground and speakers. Those were fun days!!! 🥳"
Perfect! What about Elvis us not to like- love ❤️🕺?  Wonderful product!
"This is the BEST portrayal of Elvis I have ever seen! His moves, speech, mannerisms were all as close to the real thing as you can get. I’ve been an Elvis fan my whole life and have watched him a million times. Kurt Russell really did his homework and put the work into this movie! If you are a true Elvis fan and it pains you to watch other people TRY to get it right this movie is for you. Stellar performance 🤩"

Hope they somehow connect the story with King Kong and make next chapter of what happened after skull island.<br /><br />Be able to connect or make crossover stories of King Kong with Godzillla and other Giants Creatures in the future.  Kong: skull island very entertaining watching it on my xbox one x console with 4k.<br /><br />👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🎬🦍"

"Horrible. I bought this from a different vendor. I was very disappointed. Anna was blank and her acting robotic. This was the first time I saw Blake, if you like the f-word out of her mouth every sentence this is for you. And it seemed like a rip off of Gone Girl, which I didnt like either. 👎"

"I LITERALLY love this version of Toy Story 2! About that, I have all 4 toy story movies on DVD. I have the special editions of Toy Story and Toy Story 2,  and the regular DVDs of Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 4. I ordered this with my mom on July 19th, and then received it on July 24th. Even though the film froze 4 times, I still enjoyed it. I highly recommend this film because it's a great sequel to the first one. 🙂"

"This show starts with the classic K-9 escaping from a portal to future Australia.  He  is badly damage, and reboots with a help of a kindly professor to a upgrade model.  Like the Sarah Jane Adventures, this is a about a team of kids against various monsters.  I like the role of the professor is that he is very much portray as the flawed Fifth Doctor, rather than the superhero Fourth.  It shows K-9 could of easily fit into Peter Davison’s Time Team🤓. None of the Classic Doctor Who monsters show up, which may be due to copyright.  It is a fun series on its own right*****"

"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE SEXIST BILLION YEAR OLD MALE CRITICS (and people in general) WHO HATED ON THIS MOVIE!!! It was SO GOOD I had to get it on DVD. It was forward thinking, cinema shaking, life changing female empowerment. Ok that was an exaggeration, it didn't absolutely change my life, but still it's a really great movie. Cool fight scenes and stunts, gorgeous outfits (and some comedic costume changes the Charlie's Angels franchise is known for, even in this modern power focused adaptation), immaculate soundtrack (always a pleasure to hear a girl power anthem from Miss Ariana Grande, and for this film we got an entire soundtrack of them, along with many other talented artists), and incredibly talented cast. Love it, and I wish it got the love it deserved instead of everyone hating it just because it's feminist🙄."

"I bought this for my 3 yr old granddaughter, as she had watched it a year ago and loved it. I had the case, but misplaced the DVD.  I found this one, the case has some dings, but the dvd was like new. I just put the dvd in the empty box I had from a year ago.  Now Ì get to hear her laugh so loud when Pooh spits out the bees...  How I love to hear that laugh!  💜"

"We watched this far more times than a normal person thanks to my 4yo 😂. Fantastic movie and glad to own it. There was some impression of writing on the case, which would be annoying if we were picky about our quality of the dvd cases, but since it’s for a kid it didn’t bother us much. Looked like someone down the line used it as a hard surface to write something on so the impression was left on the box."

"So here is the thing- these are 2 of my favorite movies so u can only imagine how thrilled I was to c both on one DVD 📀-<br />  Never dealt w this provider before AND never again ‼️<br />First DVD 📀 I got didn’t play at all !  I complained , returned it & received a second DVD 📀 I tried it out right away & was thrilled that this one played & on both sides !  So I put it away & got it out last night to view the movies. Much to my dismay & great disappointment the DVD was not only troublesome loading on either side BUT only ONE SIDE WILL PLAY.  I immediately tried several others from my collection of DVDs & they all loaded & played PERFECTLY ❗️ My initial order was in end of June & my replacement arrived somewhere in beginning of July so needless to say my replacement window is closed- even though I only got to see/play this DVD 📀 ONCE❗️ 😤😠🤬😩🤬 So buyers be VERY CAREFUL ‼️‼️  And it’s a shame because these are 2 great movies worth having in your collection ‼️"

"Don’t wast your money!! If I could give negative stars I would!! This is NOT formatted for USA Blu-ray, this disc clearly says region B but no where else prior to ordering is that listed anywhere! This was a Christmas present for my son, he is very disappointed and god only knows when we’ll get our refund! 🙄 Save yourself a headache and a disappointed child and DON’T BUY THIS!! Also, the packaging says “BLU-RAY + DIGITAL” there was no digital included either-complete waste!!"

"This film has the original horror and violence of Alien, some of the action of Aliens (a Cameron film), and a touch of Prometheus.  Thing is, there's a middle section that is so deep it is lost on most horror movie fans.  The series is leaving you behind, and maybe you can't keep up?  I had a hard time at first.  Answering questions about God, deep poetry and who made who?  The series is leaving the old fans behind, but not really.  This film was distrurbingly visceral, yet as deep as any film I've seen.  That's what the haters hate, it's too deep, and they just don't get it.  It's a beautiful work of art amongst a background of sheer horror.  Is Walter &#34;more human than human?&#34;  David had the human emotions implanted, and HE is the evil one, the betrayer.  Watch it again, read up, figure it out.  The ties are infinite and the story's only getting more complex.  Pay attention negative lunkheads.  😉👍👍👍👍👍.  Couldn't have been better!  Except for the shower scene...sex sells."

Who just took over her grandfather's old beat up house off some  country road ..I don't know..I just think they could have done a better job using older mature children.in there late teens tha had common sense.. and we're not so naive.. but intelligent...anyway..I think they could have done a better job...and thats my but it was good that they brought back the old original guys to finish out the movie because if they hadn't..this movie would have been a flop...so I gave it 3 stars..and that..was for original guys showing up..👍👍👍"

It was worth the wait to finally watch this movie. Afterlife was as good as good the first Ghostbusters movie. A wonderful tribute to Harold Ramis (I miss his humor) and the effort that was made to keep the movie as true as possible to the original.  👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

"Great cast. Fast paced. Good plot. Overall an enjoyable watch. My only complaint is Hollywood politicking. I haven't seen the original 1960 movie by the same title, but I doubt it has the same politicking. Peter Saarsgard who played the villainous Bartholomew Bogue had a speech in the beginning where he promoted how great capitalism is and implying he's a capitalist, while he uses coercion to take land and has sheriffs and &#34;the law&#34; on his side. This being said, he is clearly an authoritarian socialist. Free markets do not use coercion such as violence to &#34;buy&#34; or take what belongs to others. When you start forcing people to give up their land and things, you are acting outside of free market capitalism. Authorian Socialism is clearly the more greedy of the two. These little bits of ignorance in movies used to try to sway public opinion only goes to show the cluelessness of the Hollywood elite, living in a fantasy land and thinking the few should rule the many, whose idea of everything being equal means that they should have more. It annoys those who pay attention and I am happy to point it out. Thanks for hearing my rant. 😀 Now go see the movie and try not to let Hollywood overannoy you!"

"I just finished this about half an hour ago and can honestly say I was very surprised by how much I LOVED it. I did expect it to be scary, because it was under Horror on Netflix, but I am so glad it played out how it did. The actors were all amazing, the cinamatography was very well done and it was conpletwly unpredictable. Just when I thought I had it figured out...  PLOT TWIST! The ending was incredibly well done and I was actually dissapointed that it ended haha. I wanted to watch it again right after 😋 If you havent seen it, do so now because it may be one of my new favorites"

It has a much weaker (and less logical) story than all previous X-Men fims. And that says a LOT considering just how bad the plots to THOSE were. 👎👎

"I really liked how this movie depicted the Warsaw Pact, but using the frustrations of children learning how to develop both their mental and physical gifts. Being different has its own challenges, and being considered as a &#34;freak or crazy&#34; for being different by others is an additional challenge. My understanding of war can be catastrophic, but an inner war can demolish a country due to ignorance. The Warsaw Pact was design for specific countries to help one another when in need. Like people, countries have differences as well. The movie's use of children described how Jesus stated our readiness for heaven. Secondly, the children's difference did not mean that they need help. Thirdly, they only helped when needed. Lastly, like the Warsaw Pact, following the pact is the pact's connectedness to the children and the countries unity. All of the actors and actresses were superb!!! 🎇 Skg🎇"

Great movie from my past as a 17 year old kid.  Brought back tons of memories from 1987 when it was released.  Always been a favorite of mine and had to buy jt for the movie collection.  Really would have rather had it on bluray but it wasn't available on that format.  DVD is fine and it looks good and sounds good for how old it is.  Better than VHS and no issues to speak of.  Great buy for a classic movie like this.  I hope this review helps someone out there who is considering watching this classic teen movie.  👍

Love it! My only complaint is the carry case😅<br /><br />For such a cute container the case is ugly<br />We ordered a pink one and a mint green one- and they carry case is felt type material that is grey and the strap is a red/blue stripe - kind of an odd choice.<br />Would Be cuter if case at least had a neutral strap rather than red blue stripe.

"I first saw this movie several years ago, what excitement at seeing a new old i had missed. I spoke to my friends about it , and catch phrases to look for , chilly willie, B&B cocktail and more. I decided to send it to them for Christmas . Arrived in two days. Once watched they sent me two thumbs up 👍🏼👍🏼and swore it was their new holiday tradition . In turn they ordered me bottle of B&B to a nearby store in my state.<br />Heartwarming, funny, classy, inspirational, classic…a must .<br />Thank you"

"After watching movie for 1st time and my sons 3rd time, we keep getting this message and I'm not computer savvy and don't know how to rid it. Went to site it was no help because I'm not streaming, stealing, coping, etc. I paid full price for a movie I can't watch now. If anyone can give me a quick fix I would much appreciate it!!!! If too many steps, never mind, and Thank you anyways but my fuse runs short when I pay for an awesome movie that I now cannot watch.<br />I tried attaching a picture of my screen but I can't get the &#34;add a photo&#34; button to do anything.... 😓"

"I’m not sure who to blame (the vendor or amazon) but I received my package 2 weeks late. Though I am very displeased with the timing, I’m choosing not to allow the tardiness of my purchase affect the product value. The movie was in MINT condition. Brand New. The movie in general is amazing and I recommended to any and everyone. This is a MUST HAVE 🙌"

I'm on a mission to collect all of Denzel Washingtons movies on DVD. Love miss Viola Davis. (Side note: I have not actually watched this movie yet. Purchased it a few months ago. ) but I mean... Denzel is in it. And it was nominated at the white people awards 🙂

"Love the original Halloween movie,<br />But the 3rd movie season of the with is stupid.<br />Doesn't have anything to do really with the first 2 Halloween movies.<br />Don't buy the 3 movie. I recommend 124&5 Halloween movies.<br />Especially 1&2 because Jamie Lee Cutis Is in them 1 being the best.<br />But like I said # 1 is the best 2 ,4 ,5 are good as well.<br />But the first orginal is the best.🎃🎃🎃🎃"

The movie mutes the volume itself. then a voice comes out saying the movie can't be played on my device. This sucks. 👎🏾

"I skipped seeing this gem in theaters because of all the bad hype, a decision I wholeheartedly regret!<br /><br />As with all of Paul Feig’s films, Ghostbusters: Answer the Call is a laugh-out-loud experience with great action sequences the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />Some criticize the men as being ""dumbed down"" or purposefully rude/ignorant in this film, but they’re really on par with most of the bit characters in the original.<br /><br />Having grown up with the original films, comics, and cartoon series, I’m pleased to say this reboot is a refreshing take on the Ghostbusters franchise that will leave you feeling nostalgic and wanting more!<br />👻🚫"

Nice sequel. Beautiful back drops. Keep making Wonder Woman movies 🎥
Nice sequel. Beautiful back drops. Keep making Wonder Woman movies 🎥
"This is the first superhero movie I have ever really, really liked! There was a storyline, a deeper message, romance and plenty of action without being excessively violent. It was fun to be reminded of life in the excessive 80's, too.  My husband liked the movie too, though he is possibly getting tired of all my Justice League questions now and thought the movie was a little sappy at one point. Added bonus: the movie even got me more excited about exercising because who doesn't want to be more like Wonder Woman lol?! 😄. My only complaints were the fireworks and balloon because I am a little nutty when it comes to animals and the environment but I realize that's a little over the top on my end...I watched the first movie after seeing this one and now I can't wait for the next one."

I had this movie on vhs and started tossing them when DVD's came out. I couldn't find it on DVD anywhere and it was one my wife liked 😳<br />I finally found it on DVD but it was for Region 2 only.<br />Now finding it on Blu Ray made my year. Thanks for having it available. ✌

I can not watch this movie! Says it can't read code in the DVD player? I guess it's a bootleg movie!!😠😠😠

"Unfortunately😥...this purchase did not work for me. I ordered it and it was delivered as promised but the issue is my DVD is for another region and didn't know that when I ordered it, and I made the mistake of not returning it in time, so I'm now stuck with a brand new DVD pack of movies that I can't watch. I ordered them again from somewhere else, but next time I will check for the region."

"You can always count on Sam Fuller:  his style  and purpose seems to be to give you/the viewer something to think about well after the movie has ended.  Admittedly I’m sure some movie fans will wonder if they like his movie(s) or not — like good beer Fuller may be an acquired taste — but there is little denying the fact he is consistently unique with the western Forty Guns following in uniquely bizarre, western suit.<br /><br />I, also, agree that for a movie that is noted for its sex talk and innuendo it is all rather dated because in 1957 there’s only so much sex you can sell and the eventual heavy petting scenes come across unintentionally humorous.  There is also a surviving the tornado storm scene which leaves the two stars basically unscathed but, more importantly I guess, In the throes of heavy petting by way of their narrow, tornado escape.<br />Although filmed in black and white Fuller admits being inspired by Johnny Guitar (Anthony Mann’s The Furies, too) and like the Nicholas Ray, symbolically colorful classic (I believe Johnny Guitar overrated) Forty Guns has its own layer of symbolism.<br /><br />Another unique aspect of Forty Guns:  the music of guitar (of course) and singer is not played off camera.  In one scene he walks into an outdoor scene of 5(?) men bathing in western tubs and it feels like the beginning of a musical number — but it’s not (a musical number).  Was I supposed to laugh?<br />There is also some getting used to John Ericson’s troubled younger brother performance to the powerful and domineering Barbara Stanwyck.  She plays nepotism to the hilt.  SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />Ericson laughs and over acts, shoots the sheriff, she bails him out, and it takes a real man to open her eyes—as well as her heart—to finally realize her bro is no good.<br /><br />Well, I just wrote a fairly sarcastic review for 40 Guns but I am planning on watching this again very soon.  I know I’ll see something or pickup on some interesting dialogue that will open my eyes or make me laugh when I’m supposed to.<br />And I’m already re-considering Ericson’s performance as pre determined by Fuller.<br />It is entertaining which may be the point?<br />Oh, and I’m noticing Barry Sullivan (Tension) as a surprisingly interesting stoic actor.  Good as Wyatt Earp aka Griff Bonnell.  His younger brother is played by Gene Barry (Bat Masterson on tv eventually).<br />Criterion DVD extras are good.  It is surprising no commentary while watching 40 Guns though.  Fuller is interviewed circa 1969 and says little about 40 Guns.  Good booklet to read which is part of the reason I know I’ll be watching again, soon, in its entirety for, basically, the third time.<br />4.0 Guns (stars🎸😜)"

"I love this movie! I read a very long and negative breview about this movie, so here’s my take on it:<br />I don’t think Annie’s character is a loser, but I disagree with that.  Annie was just having a run of bad luck, but she was an amazing baker.  The girl had talent! She also was treated badly by men, so when Officer Rhoades actually treated her like a lady, she wasn’t used to that.<br />As far as Helen’s character goes, she’s not as bad as she seems.  Initially, yes.  She did come between Annie and life long friend Lillian, who is the bride.  Deep down, Helen was insecure and just wanted friends.  Her rich husband is always gone away on business, and her step kids hate her.  She laughs it off, but that’s obviously a facade.  Lillian was the bride with one best friend and one wannabe best friend.  At the end , she was upset about Helen taking over all wedding plans.  Megan was hilarious and down to earth.  She definitely knew how to keep it real.<br />I loved Wilson Phillips performing Hold On was the perfect finish.  I enjoy watching this movie with a big glass of wine.  It’s the ultimate Friday night chick flick.  Even the guys will find this movie entertaining. 😃"

"A quintessential essential if you have a 50's Sci-Fi collection. Great story. Superb color. Great long length. A fan favorite for over 60 years. First exposed to this as a young man in the 70's reading Monster Magazines and the newspaper...'The Monster Times'. Back then you had to wait forever and pray your nearest big city (Detroit) had it in their inventory. Then, you had to be lucky enough to catch it. Finally I was able to watch it by ordering it off Amazon. The 'alien/monsters' are featured in almost every tome about Science Fiction Movies. Never dreamt as a kid I'd have a perfect copy years later to watch over and over. Great G/PG rated fun that you can watch w your nieces and nephews and not scare them to death. You have to judge for yourself if it's for you, but you're reading the reviews, so it must be on your purchasing radar. Buy it. 👽"
"A quintessential essential if you have a 50's Sci-Fi collection. Great story. Superb color. Great long length. A fan favorite for over 60 years. First exposed to this as a young man in the 70's reading Monster Magazines and the newspaper...'The Monster Times'.

"I liked ALL the references to Stephen King's writing. Especially the unique perspective of Jake Chambers being ""DRAWN"" into Endworld via the haunted house.<br /><br />It was glaringly obvious that he & Roland Deschain were going to have to stop the wolves & breakers in Thunderclap from ""breaking"" the beams that supported the Dark Tower.<br /><br />The final battle @ The Dixie Pig was another interesting Hollywood adaption (sorry kids, no spoiler alert here 😭). If you have not read any of the 8 book Dark Tower/Gunslinger series I think you'll still enjoy this movie. But -- I may be just a tad biased since I've read the entire series 4 times, so<br />HAH !  😂<br /><br />bmg, silicon valley, ca"

I really  liked this movie . And yes I  have read the entire  Dark Tower  series and  the movie  is  different from the books but so what IT IS  STILL  A GREAT M9VIE.  Anyway  - if you have  read all the Dark Tower  books then  why wouldn't you want to see  a different  view of the  Dark  Tower  on film ??<br />  My opinion  is  - -<br />If you have not seen this movie yet  you  will not be  disappointed- it will  hold your attention for sure.  It is worth  watching  at least once - It has a good  storyline  and  great  actors  and  cool action scenes  especially  the  final  show down  with gunslinger  and  man in black . Well  for what it is  worth  that's  my opinion- - GOD BLESS 💙💙

"I knew I was watching a cinematic tour de force when Mandy hits the 85 minute mark and Nicolas Cage channels his inner Scarface by inhaling a literal mountain of cocaine off a broken slab of mirrored glass after breaking some demonic hybrid gimp's neck with a well placed Stone Cold Stunner. It then proceeds to pull the veil back at the 87 minute mark and melts your mind with a drug-induced hallucinogenic vision with visual effects that mirror 'Altered States,' one of the best movies of the 80s if not all time.<br /><br />Mandy is what would happen if Gaspar Noe remade Kill Bill. It's easily one of the best synthwave-metalcore revengeance movies you're ever going to see in the new age. The movie is a masterclass in the art of slowburn narrative and utilizing cerebral visual fx to simulate a dreamy sense of euphoria within the viewerfinally, after more than an hour of what seems like a terrible Nicolas Cage romance movie with a Lovecraftian color palette and script marred by contrived religious dialogue, the film does a massive 180 when, as if in true Gaspar Noe-ian fashion, the titlecard with a graffitied 'Mandy' in massive synthwave font obliterates the screen name resets it to.complete darkness, as if to signify that the 75 minute mark is the true start of the film and that fade to Black was just your born again baptism with blackmetal intent. Once the fade to black titlecard sequence refades back in to the movie, it continues at the Apex of Mandy's plot where Nicolas Cage poetically transforms the spirit and nature of his character into a hardened wrecking ball manimal, hell bent on catering absolute destruction to those who set fire to his passion and burned to cinder everything that he once loved. It's one of those rate occasions where Cage's insanity and terrible acting are actually emboldened and improved by the director's craft and the film's overall production and tone.<br /><br />A rare gem and a complete feast for the eyes and the soul; a lovestory unlike any other. This ain't your Mama's ""Notebook"" with Ryan Gosling 🤭🤭😆"

"This movie was just a plain badass, twisted, trippy, psycho, mind rush of a primal fury action movie, blended with horror and surreal beauty! Cage was magnificent, as was Risebourogh, although the baddies stole the show with subtle undertones of humor! Cage delivers his signature raging psycho scream, then goes on the rampage! No mind altering drugs needed to enjoy this brilliant masterpiece! Highly recommended... 💀💀💀💀💀"

"Anything with Lance Henriksen is worth seeing.  I love the mentoring scene of his character with Damien.  He adds so much flavor to off beat sci fi and horror pics.  William Holden is no Gregory Peck but a solid performance of a supporting father figure who slowly starts to see the evil of Damien.  Nice continuity to have the Bugenhagen character in both pics.  Also enjoyed the created archaeological pieces to create backstory (Yigael's Wall,  Seven daggers 🗡 of Megiddo, Whore of Babylon statue).  Nice way to draw one in to the story.  I also really enjoyed Jonathan Scott Taylor performance as Damien.  It’s not as good a movie overall as the first movie but solid enough.  And there’s enough continuity to make it pretty watchable.  Similar creepy Crow scenes with scary Latin chants.  And yes, that’s a pre Falcon Crest Robert Foxworth. And Pasarian is easily identified as Dr Sid Freedman from M.*A.*S.*H. So some talented cast members.  Deaths are cheesy by today’s standards for horror and special effects.  But a good period piece from the era that brought us Rosemary’s Baby and The Exorcist.  In my opinion this movie and the original are more exciting than Rosemary’s Baby but don’t scare to the point of The Exorcist. I saw this movie as a child and I couldn’t sleep for about a week.  So it holds a special place in horror movie lore for me even if it’s not as scary as it was in the 70s."

"Extremely good acting and scenes of 1980's New York, with successful and educated people<br />In their fifties wearing Ralph Lauren wool sweaters and suits.  They meet in restaurants and at the opera and live in very nice apartments and houses.  But true to the malaise of all 20th C films, they are unhappy and lonely, with successive affairs and broken marriages ruining their lives.<br /><br />Marion Post is a Professor of Philosophy and head of an undergraduate department.  She is turning fifty and takes a sabbatical to write a book, and for even less distraction, she takes an apartment of her own to do the writing.  Her husband is a cardiovascular surgeon.  He is a busy and practical man, and yet ever patient and willing to go out with friends to all kinds of events.  For him and Marion, this is a second marriage.  His first wife does make an entrance, namely a big scene at his birthday party with the new wife and old friends.  She is seen as hysterical and he &#34;accepts her condemnation&#34;', since he started the affair with Marion before marrying Marion.  There is a grown daughter and she likes Marion, her stepmother.<br /><br />All this is presented to us as matter of fact😃, an admirable story of hard work and success<br /><br />But for Marion, a chance overhearing of a psychiatric patient's sad life begins to tilt her own thoughts to her own emptiness.  She begins to realize people think her cold and callous and too intellectual, and that she has deprived herself of passion and real living.  An old teenage time friend gets angry at her for stealing a boyfriend back then. A brother who's divorcing and not employed seriously and needing money: she realizes she never knew his real life.  She was too busy being a brilliant student and having an affair with a professor.<br /><br />There is no doubt that this film was lovingly and carefully produced with outstanding actors. What I don't quite agree with is that our main protagonist has to feel so empty.  Is it really because of her career success and intellectual life?  In that case, why not show us that life, the university and the books and her colleagues and students?  Could that be so empty?<br /><br />She seems to be on her own all the time.  Bizarre.<br /><br />And could she really have been herself if she just quit school and became a housewife and mother through some accidental pregnancy with a much much older professor?  She would not have been herself to have chosen that path. The first wife of the surgeon did seem to be only a mother and was a mental mess.  So clearly that path looks rotten too. The psychiatric patient (Mia Farrow) is very pregnant and does not seem to have any serious work or to have studied.  So she is a mess too, without accomplishment.<br /><br />Only the men and not all of them are shown as doing fine.  Her lover in midlife, whom she did not marry, played by an old gene Hackman, found another woman and had a daughter.  He is publishing a book and is happy and successful and fulfilled as a fAtjer and husband.<br /><br />I don't think that there is any path for any women that leads to happiness in this film.<br /><br />Yet it was clear to me that a brilliant cerebral person like the surgeon or Marion would have to follow their own destiny and a great career.  If they had not they would be miserable.<br /><br />Nonetheless a great story.  And don't let other people'/s judgment of you stop you from loving and living in your own way.  This woman Marion worried too much about all that and came to despise her own life."
This movie is a great kids movie and adult movie. My kids who are 6 and 3 stayed quiet this whole movie and so did i and their grandma. This is a cute movie. It had adult and child humor. i would definitely recommend it. I dont know why it would get less then 5 starts. Some people 😑

My husband and I watched this movie at The Alamo Drafthouse. It's definitely a movie you'd want to watch again. It's action packed and kept me drawn to it the whole time. Never once did I think it was boring.<br />I am going to purchase the Blu-ray version. It is definitely on my list of favorites. 👍🏽

"I never understood why critics in 1998 didn't get this movie as they obviously never got the memo that the EMI original series was tongue in cheek and had fun with the spy genre.<br />I guess Austin Powers had just released and with the Spice Girls and David Beckham taking over the planet "" Rue Britania"" had ran it's course which is a shame because this stylish and witty film deserves better than the Abysmal score it's gotten from review aggregates.<br />It's FAR better than anything released since 1998.<br />This Film is beautifully photographed and gets right to the central plot of Sean Connery ( Sir August DeWinter ) and his insane plot to extort the world into buying their weather from him or else.<br />Opposing him is super reserved and stylish John Steed ( Ralph Fiennes decades before he joined MI6 in Skyfall and before becoming a Kingsman 👑 ) and the highly capable and super sexy Emma Peel ( Uma Thurman ) who has to prove her innocence.<br />Supporting cast is a who's who of Future Harry Potter stars and legends like Jim Broadbent, Fiona Shaw, Carmen Egogo and Eddie Izzard.<br />There's even a cameo from original John Steed Patrick Macnee himself.<br />Funny, Overly British and Stylish over any real substance but I think THAT was the point and no one got this back in 1998.<br />Also the soundtrack is Superb featuring end credit tracks from Suggs, Ashtar Command and the legendary Grace Jones.<br />The Main music score by John McNeely is absolutely beautiful and Ethereal especially during the scenes filmed at Sir August DeWinters Mansion ( the actual home of the Duke of Marboro.<br />The Avengers 1998 has everything you would want in a British spy film and there's nothing offensive here for families. Also Uma Thurman in that black costume is UNBELIEVABLE ❤️.<br />The Avengers is an excellent addition to anyone's British film marathon and is easily one of my favorite movies of all time<br />OUTSTANDING<br />🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧"
"I watched this as a kid and was expecting the graphics to be awful, but considering when this was made... I was pleasantly surprised and the storyline was great. I was surprised at all the random stuff I remembered. What a great show to rewatch 👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<br />#80'sKid"

"I loved this movie as a kid, and couldn't wait to show it to my kids!! I was very pleased with how well the story and themes have stood the test of time, even if the special effects haven't! 😉 I only counted one curse word in the whole thing (which may not be important to some, but is to me.) It was a fun adventure to share this with my kids!!"

I was very happy with the speed in which I got it. It was in good condition and played perfectly. It was a Christmas present for my 7 year old and turned out to be one of the best movies he has seen he says. 😊

"I dont remember seeing the original version of Valley girl so this could be a stand alone version if you haven't seen it before.the only thing i have an issue with is the ending where,spoilers,the mom says life happened as a reason for the realistic ending.i wanted a gummy sweet romatical ending.The Randy character was a true rebel without a cause.Tho not as hunky as James Dean😊 The duet from.the 80s like U2s was the best song.it was Romeo&Juliet-ish minus any death scenes.Jake Paul ,Alicia Silverstone,Judy Greer,&Mae Whitman were supporting roles that made it cooler 😎"

I cried almost the whole time. Sometimes for sadness and sometimes for how proud I was of Bart Millard for all he had overcome and the beauty that God brought into his life through it all. Absolutely worth seeing. 💖

"I will give 5 stars because this is one of my favorite tv shows from the 70's!  But what I was not happy with was how the case is paperback and the DVD's are in single/double sided sleeves, I was getting confused 😐 on which one I just watched. Also I do not like how you remove the DVD from the paperback sleeve it seems as I am scratching the DVD that aggravates me!  The exterior of the case should have made with the regular hard case and each individual dvd clicked on as I have my rest of the other dvds I own, like I said the show picture, sounds and lighting is great just the case I'm not happy with😐"

This movie is truly a gem. It brought me back to my childhood days. Each character I have a friend who identifies with them. That’s what makes it so comical. This movie has me wanting to prank my friends of 45 years (and there are 10 of us!)  Their motto from the movie is so true: “We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.” KEEP PLAYING GUYS!🥰

There are many R rated movies that I find hilarious.  My husband thought this was a really funny movie.  There were times it was funny but too over the top for me. Constant swearing and profanity  I have nothing against swearing in movies.  Zac Efron shows his body through the movie for dumb reasons.  It could have been funnier if I wrote it😀

"Even though I’ve seen this classic movie on the TCM channel, it’s still one of my favorite movies of all times!!! It was one of the greatest hits of that era and it’s a shame they don’t make movies like these anymore. It’s funny, sweet, and romantic especially with Doris Day singing in the bar/restaurant or when she & Rock Hudson we’re driving in the highway on the way to a cabin while Doris Day sings ‘Possess Me’ in the background!?? Or when she cried all 80 miles from an cabin in Connecticut to New York after she found out that Rock Hudson’s character isn’t what she expected?!? Funny scene 😂😂😂😂!"

"A classic swashbuckler film that my father watched once when I was very young. One day we watched again as a family, and I knew it was worth buying on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The main menu of the movie shows scenes in the far right corner with soft music playing. It’s music that you can fall asleep to. It’s okay for a menu I guess. The film is distributed by Touchstone Pictures, which is owned by Walt Disney Pictures. Unfortunately, that means this title can not be used with Vudu Disc to Digital, as Disney is keen on making you pay full price for a digital version of a title you own.<br /><br />The artwork is pretty cool, and the disc displays the amazing artwork that comes with it. What I love the most is now I can watch this movie along with “The Mask of Zorro” and “The Three Musketeers (1993)”. Time for a Saturday where I just watch swashbucklers. 👍🏽"

"Tho an oldie, Ghost Town is definitely a goldie!  A fantastic  movie to watch and own! I have adored this classic since I was a little girl and I was very pleased to find this on DVD, but unfortunately, as advertised, it is not multi format, it is only blu-ray format.  Glad my roommate has a blu-ray player!  I was also a little disappointed with the condition of the case and packaging, but, the disc played just fine.. but yeah, I wanted the case in mint condition because I really value the movie and would consider it a collectable. I would give this a 5 star rating if the case came in flawless condition.  I even ordered it twice and it arrived in the same beat up condition both times. I'd share pictures, but it won't let me upload them from my phone.  It looked as if the case was wrinkled from water damage and the packaging had holes all over it.  As far as rating the movie itself, definitely a 5 star!  I am very fond of Jimmie F Skaggs because he was a great actor (one of my favorites) and he is sorely  missed in movies.  RIP, good Sir. 😌<br /><br />Regardless of the packaging, tho, I'm still very pleased and proud to own this rare classic. 💖<br />Eventually, I will give this a 5 star rating when the case arrives in much better condition next time,  but for now,  I'm very grateful to have it to watch. Thank you for having this movie Amazon."

"If you enjoy your gore be sure to check this out. A little of the acting silly or over the top but it’s still a fun flick to check out. Body parts cut up, dismembered, and even a scene where the star is kissing  a “real” decapitated head what more could a horror fan want?😈🤣"

"Vampyros Lesbos is a product of its time, so attempting to view it through a 21st century lens can be difficult when sober. You will not gasp at how realistic the blood looks, so let's clear that up straight away. This motion picture was intended as an abstract presentation nearly a half-century ago, so as you can guess, it's even more true now.<br />Vampyros Lesbos has been called many things, but minus the music I rather liked it.<br /><br />PROs<br />✔ This Blu-ray provides a sharp, 1080p transfer in an aspect ratio of 1.66:1. Despite the encoding not being optimized, you don't want to see the alternative.<br />✔ Soledad Miranda, of course. This movie was filmed in the summer of 1970 directly prior to her death by car at the age of 27. As the story goes, she had just been offered a multi-year contract and would have become an international star had it not been for the untimely accident (honestly, is there ever a good time to die horribly from a car crash?) She was extremely photogenic, which is plain for anyone to see in Vampyros Lesbos... stunning is an appropriate word. Before working with Jesús Franco, Soledad was more or less typecast in Spanish films as someone you wouldn't expect to see star in Franco's dark films, although from an early age she did show diversity in her talent.<br />✔ Can't quite put my finger on it, but I felt compelled to keep watching... no, not because of Soledad's apparent distaste for wearing garments, although that surely wasn't a disincentive. The urge certainly wasn't due to a fondness for 1970 (yucky haircuts, yucky wardrobes, ad infinitum), so it must have been the cohesive weirdness?<br />✔ Soledad's character (Condesa Oskudar, aka Countess Nadine Carody) was related to Dracula... now that's some legit credentials! If you watch the Stephen Thrower featurette that comes on the disc, you'll learn of parallels between Vampyros Lesbos and Bram Stoker's Dracula you never would have guessed otherwise.<br />✔ Due mostly to the vintage nature of Vampyros Lesbos, there is now a chance to laugh where the director did not intend for us to find humor. Yet Jesús Franco was not without a sense of humor; for example, the early scene of Linda at her psychiatrist's. He also makes a cameo in the film as a slimy psychopath, which is both creepy and jocular if you know it's him.<br /><br />CONs<br />✘ A soundtrack that has been described elsewhere as &#34;excruciating&#34; (I could not agree more), yet is revered by others. It's almost unfathomable that people at some point in time found this music acceptable for any purpose, but whatever floats your boat, I guess.<br />✘ While Vampyros Lesbos intuitively feels likes a series of visions that should be ocularly consumed while intoxicated on some kind of psychedelic substance, it also seems like you might have a horrible time if you attempted that.<br />✘ There's no shortage of aspects from the film that people seem to dislike. Just don't get the idea that because Soledad does most of her acting in this one without words that she is not a good actor. Soledad is solid, and you'll find this to be true simply by her screen presence.<br /><br />Extras, bonus/special features (all in 1080p, although the movie clips are of variable quality).<br />💀 Interview with writer/director Franco.<br />💀 Stephen Thrower (a Franco expert) on mostly Vampyros Lesbos; a bit academic but also entertaining.<br />💀 Sublime Soledad: Amy Brown on Soledad (and a little on Franco, since the two worked together). This is a super-informative interview about how amazing Soledad Miranda was, very glad to have watched it despite the unhappy ending.<br />💀 Jess Is Yoda: I won't spoil this for you!<br />💀 Trailer(s)"

"What's really admirable about this film is John Travolta's incredible dancing. there was so much hero-worship going on when he was a disco dancer in Bay Ridge at 2001 Odyssey. He was the king claimed his pals. In Staying Alive, his dancing is elevated to a superior level, and he becomes a little fish in a big pond competing with other dancers in the world of the Broadway Arena. it was interesting the way they film showed the raw intensity of a dancer's life, and the movie stands on its own apart from Saturday Night Fever as an entertaining film. I really dug this flick😝😝😝"

"I read all of the views warning me, but I took the risk - mainly because the Blu-Ray was cheaper than the DVD. It's got a fake ""20TH Anniversary"" cardboard cutout glued to the top of the original Blu-Ray case. I DID receive the Blu-Ray and Digital Copy, so I am not too upset. Just warning everyone; if you already have this movie, don't buy it again. I didn't own it already, so I'm satisfied. 🤷‍♀️"

"I would like to first start saying the reason I bought this laserdisc because that's the only way I could watch the DELETED SCENES BUT, Unfortunately it shows you more story boards than the actual deleted scenes from the FILM 🎥. I was Highly disappointed that it didn't show you alot of deleted scenes - just alot of story boards that's Comics. Even though I grew up watching this Film and Iam a huge fan of (Dead presidents -1995.) More than (Menace to society-1993.) This was extremely disappointment coming from a criterion collection. The criterion collection is supposed to show you More of the extended , deleted scenes of the film. If they want to include storyboards Make sure that is separate from the deleted scenes of the film because when it's together you will confuse the audience. I'm still a HUGE FAN Of Dead Presidents, but I wouldn't recommend this coming from the criterion collection that should have include alot more Deleted actual scenes from humans that's in the film (NOT STORYBOARDS !) The only thing that was great was the story of the real Anthony, Ari Merretazon documentary. THE CRITERION COLLECTION Was a Extremely disappointment of Dead presidents (1995.)"

Quite Fantastic to finally see this in widescreen...and restored. I remember it from T.V. and bought this to replace the improperly formated dvd version I bought at Wal-Mart long ago. It looks awesome! Great commentary.<br />Definitely a worthwhile upgrade! William Shatner is pretty damn good in this one. Musically supported by ques from Twilight Zone and the Kolchak series?...Correct me if im wrong! But to me this 1977 Cult Classic offering is a must for any old sci-fi fans out there. This was definitely worth upgrading in my collection. A creative fun nostalgic ride with a Twilight Zone vibe!<br />👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍<br />✌️❤️🙂

DVD would not play... an icon that popped up that said “prohibited”<br />I googled it and learned that this DVD was likely made out of the country and would not play on DVD players not made in that region.<br />Unfortunately I saved this movie to watch with my family when we were celebrating my dads birthday and didn’t open it and discover it would not play until 10 days past the return window. VERY disappointed 😞

"""Harriet"" is an awesome movie!!! It is a testament to the greatness of the great Harriet Tubman! Everything about ""Harriet"" is preeminent: from the historical content of the movie woven into Gregory Allen Howard's script, to the supporting actors and actresses and extras, to the music of Terrence Blanchard, to Paul Tazewell costumes, all under the masterful direction of Kasi Lemmons!  Yet, what brings the great Harriet Tubman to life, is the phenomenal portrayal of the great Harriet Tubman by Cynthia Erivo!!<br /><br />""Harriet"" is one of the best movies ever! And, for all of those who saw it, they unanimously echo my sentiments! And, despite the unrelenting efforts by people who have not seen it and those online (Twitter and You Tube) opponents who tried their very hardest to sabotage it, and some of them are on Amazon trying to do the same thing, the movie was a huge success! Cynthia Erivo has become a bigger success and is in hot demand!<br /><br />I have read Catherine Clinton's book, ""Harriet Tubman: Road To Freedom."" I have listened to Sarah Bradford's biography on the great Harriet Tubman. I have also watched and listened to Kate Larson talk about the great Harriet Tubman. So, when you see this movie, you see the history come to life! When you see this movie, you see the great Harriet Tubman in Cynthia Erivo!<br /><br />I saw ""Harriet"" 10 times in theaters. The movie never got old,...it got better each time that I saw it! I now own the DVD. And, let me tell you, the DVD is even better! Because of the superlative ""Bonus Features"" added to the movie. In closing, within the segment ""Deleted Scenes."" After Harriet Tubman and John Tubman are reunited and he subsequently leaves. The deleted scene shows you how Harriet walks over to John Tubman's house and sees him with his wife Carolyn. I will not go any further.  But, that scene is so powerful! I don't understand why they left it out of the movie.<br /><br />See ""Harriet"" for yourself! Buy the DVD and share it with everyone you know. It is awesome!!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 👍👍 🏆🏆 😃"

"Dc fan smh !!! So much potential, but the movie sucks... Unless you typically enjoy Marvel movies then this movie is right up your alley👍🏼 Lots of garbage CGI, cringe-worthy jokes, useless villan, and a dumpster fire plot!"

"Ever since Joss Whedon's pathetically watered down, and severely edited theatrical cut of Justice League was released back in 2017, I've had an empty void left inside of me yearning for Zack Snyder's original cut to see the light of day. Some said that would never happen... but, finally, it's here! And, boy, was it worth the wait! Snyder's newly restored 4-hour cut is now available to stream on HBOmax(which I've watched 3 times already), and is rumored to have a 4K Blu-ray release this summer for those who don't have HBOmax!<br /><br />If the Whedon cut felt incomplete, and lacking everything that the DC Snyderverse had built up to until now, is because it was! Man, that 2 hour theatrical cut doesn't hold a flame to the fire of the Snyder Cut. There is so much more heart and soul, and character development in the new version! The Flash and Cyborg actually serve as VERY significant plot points this time around(especially the Flash), instead of the throw away stand-ins they were in the 2017 version. Now we even get to see the big bad villain, Darkseid(DC's equivalent to Thanos from the Marvel films) that the previous Batman v Superman film was hinting at, and that Whedon decided to just throw out the window completely. Even the original villain, Steppenwolf(now with a completely new design and voice), feels more threatening than before. I was actually annoyed by the original, whiny Steppenwolf. But, this new incarnation had me glued to the screen, and actually had me feeling sorry for him at times. He has way more depth and layers this time around. To put it simply, after bearing witness to the Snyder Cut, I can't even watch the JOSStice League garbage anymore. Tried to, but shut it off after 20 minutes... it so empty now. I think it's actually sad that the studio left Zack Snyder's name attached as director, seeing that only 25% of his original cut actually made it into the theatrical release. The rest was reshot by Whedon, who was only giving a credit as co-writer. So, until now, Zack was blamed for all the abysmal faults of the theatrical cut, in which wasn't even his doing. There was too much drama behind the making of this flick, and I'm glad it can all finally be put to rest.<br /><br />To support Zack's original vision, and the efforts he and all of us fans put into getting his cut released, I will DEFINITELY be buying the new Snyder Cut as soon as it's released on Blu-ray... and will most likely be blowing-up the original 2017 release just in time for fireworks season this summer! It'll be nice watching it burn up and fade away! 🤣<br />We can all finally say ""we done with Whedon"", and... ""hooray for the SNYDER CUT""!"

"I love the movie,but I Really love the audio commentary track. Anytime you get kurt russel and john carpenter together,it's gonna be fun. They didn't just talk about big trouble..they talked about all the other movies they worked on . If you like commentary...this is a great buy. Also, get Escape from new york... another great commentary😁"

"Such an amazing film!! It really does justice to the group.  The acting 🎭 is awesome 👏🏾 and the cinematography is superb.  And Christopher Walken steals every scene in which he appears.  I was so upset when Netflix dropped it that I bought it at once.  Fun, fun, fun movie 🍿!"

"This movie is SO very important for me to see and reflect upon. As I love Liam Neeson, he’s slammed each and every movie he’s ever done (especially the 3 “Taken” movies) and if I could EVER meet him, that would be THE most special event in my life. Nawww not a groupy or crazy lady, just “call it as I see it’. 😘. Fabulous movie. 25 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

"Bad acting (with the exception of shailene woodley who tries to save it) awful cliched writing and bad, weird direction. Lots of pointless conversations that go nowhere. MAJOR over acting by the mom- I laughed at a lot of parts that were supposed to be serious. Just bad.<br /><br />Where’s mom? Huh. That’s funny her car and all her stuff is here…<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT 🚨<br />Have you checked under the frozen meatballs?"

"I didn't know what to expect. I got this because the 4K reviews for picture and sound were top notch. Otherwise, I would have gotten just the blu-ray.  Also, I have yet to see Cate Blanchett suck in any role. Yes, yes, total fanboy here but I am serious. Her and Jack Black played well off each other. The scare factor was just rightalthough I heard some kids couldn't handle it in theaters.  Really liked the supporting cast addition of Renee Elise Goldsberry and Kyle MacLachlan. Had no clue they were in it and that was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />All in all, it was an enjoyable and entertaining film. I'm pleased to add it to my small 4K collection. 🙂"

The toilet paper diary writing scene by evey in isolation lock-up. A total of 4 minutes cut. This version is not meant for the us😭 it is only for the U.K. if watched in English."

I saw this movie in the theater. It has become my very favorite Christmas Carol movie. I’ve watched on YouTube but it is so grainy and picture quality is terrible. I was so excited to find this movie. I’m going my mother-in-law’s house the week before Thanksgiving and I’m taking this movie with me. She has never seen it. I’m excited to share it with her. You must buy this movie. It’s the most fun and joyful movie you’ll see for the season and never wanting it to end. It’s a musical and I kept backing it up in different parts because I wanted to hear the music again. You’ll want to get up and dance. This is one movie I would have loved to have been an extra end. A must buy for the entire family. Enjoy and Merry Christmas 🎄🎄🎄🎅🏼🎅🏼🎅🏼

"This is my mother in law's favorite Christmas movie, and her favorite version of The Christmas Carol. She likes Albert Finney - I think she has a crush on him. 😊 I bought this movie in Amazon for her a few years ago, but she lost it during a move. The other day, she asked if I would buy it for her again. She said watching this movie is the only thing that puts her in the Christmas spirit. How can I refuse that request? 😊 Merry Christmas!"

Gr8 movie-original interesting script - good casting/acting 🤩& a very welcomed though quite rare Blu-ray Tm disc with a consistently crystal clear picture clarity rating in the mid 30’s MegaBitsPerSecond !! It can be done so why all the other Blu-ray’s in the 20’s+teens?

I was kind of nervous to buy this set because a couple people said it was only bonus scenes but I trust Amazon so I took a chance for the price and my daughter really wanted them.... it turned out my trust in Amazon didn't fail me it was the movies my daughter loved them 😊

"Early 70s horror film staring Vincent Price and Peter Cushing.... Great fun, and hardly ever on television anymore<br />Looking pretty good on blu-ray, if a little soft and grainy... The audio track is out of sync in parts of thd film,<br />which is annoying.. 😐"

"The worse Eddie Murphy movie ever made, quite possible the worse movie of all time!  just horrible and too damn ""woke"" when is Hollywood gonna realize that ? Ugh! their political lines were too damn left leaning and I'm not even into politics like that and yet i knew where this crapper was going the first 20 minutes. however it did put me to sleep so that's why I'm giving it 1 star🤦‍♂️"

I would use 0 stars if I could. I just literally opened it and it doesn’t work. It has scratches all over it and it almost looks as if submerged in water when they tried to rip off the movie. 🙄🙄🙄🙄

I was impressed,  and that in itself surprised me! Recommended  !!!"

"I bought this for my 20 year old who watched it on demand and felt compelled to have a physical copy. Bad special effects, insane plot line. A priest who turns into a TRex and eats people.  I’ve not only seen parts of the movie, (fell asleep. I’m 51 and a teacher. I fall asleep any time I’m on a couch)  however, when I was awake I saw a giant inflatable trex costume eating people. Worth every penny and then some. Cinematic gem 😂"

"Ah, what a movie can unleash in the psyche. This movie took hold & cast a spell on me when it first came out.  I had a similar experience as a young girl.  Lolita’s actions and mannerisms in this and the 1962 film touched a nerve. Every actor portrayed their character perfectly, except the mommy., she was too pretty. :)<br />The real stunner is the cinematography and soundtrack! Takes my breath away every time I rewatch it. Bongo, bongo, bongo I don’t want to leave the Congo oh no, no, no, no 🎶"

I gave this movie only 1 star because that is all it's worth... it would seem to me that these excellent actors must have been broke financially and truly needed the money..to make a movie like this.. because it is truly awful.. and the movie kept putting chapter counts for each Act which was truly truly unnecessary which made this movie even more stupid... so if you are truly looking for a good cowboy movie I would sincerely pass this one up and not purchase it because I truly do not recommend it.. great actors but a terrible terrible script.. and if I would have watched this movie in the theaters I truly would have asked for my money back it is that bad...👎👎👎👎👎

I think I bought this while I was drunk and rambling to a friend about how I watched this movie in the 90's. I honestly didn't know they made this into a DVD so I was pretty excited and had fun reliving one of my childhood favourites in a clear picture with the nostalgic 90's content. My favourite book is still the fantasy one after all these years. 🥰 I highly recommend getting this if you were a fan of the VHS version back in the day.

"First of all...I'm a seasoned horror fanatic, 65 years young. Was at the premiere of ALIEN and there for Halloween 1978. WTH is wrong with people? The Strangers: Prey at Night was amazingly intense horror at it's BEST! This movie was far superior than the first... The Strangers! I haven't been scared senseless in a long while, and THIS movie did it for me! Yes...there are cliche' tropes, but that is what we as viewers have come to expect and love in horror films! The people that rated this movie one or two stars are basically shallow minded and lame. You're probably jaded and can't figure out how to enjoy a GREAT HORROR FILM anymore!?! I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS FILM and was yelling out loud during specific scenes. Yeah, there's some really goofy stuff here and there, but if you wanna poop your pants, this movie will do it for you! Forget what the lamos have to say, and listen to what I'm telling you....Really? ""This movie was stupid."" WTH kind of review is that? I'll not let you in on anything except for the fact that this movie was BRILLIANT! See it for yourself. You WILL NOT BE SORRY!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🔪🗡☠<br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! 🙀"

I liked it as much as the first. Creepy and scary. The final act was far fetched as hell but have you seen the trailer for the new Rock movie? 🙄 We loved it.

It was astonishing to see when it first came out because of the special access to the Forbidden City in Beijing granted to Bertolucci. I purchased a dvd 📀 years ago but my copy got lost so I was delighted 😁 to have it replaced.

"Detroit Rock City is a very funny comedy about 4 highschool friends Hawk, Lex, Trip and Jam who are in a rock band called Mystery. They lose  they're tickets to see they're favorite band Kiss. In Detroit that night so they split up and try to each find away to get a ticket to the show. Along the way they have to deal with crazy disco fans car thieves and 1 psycho mother. Full of laughs from start to finish. Starting Edward Furlong as Hawk and Kiss themselves and sexy Shannon Tweed. Detroit Rock City is a rock n roll cult classic and should be in everyone's collection. 5 🌟"

This is great and funny show. The cast works well together and the comedy is fresh and self deprecating. A total 5 stars!<br />PS. Make sure you have the correct DVD player to support this UK formatted show😊

". . . but the examined one is no bargain.”<br />When the uncle said this, the wife, martini midair, at the Club on New Year’s Day, was like 😳 (She’d gotten the prickly neighbor killed by the family’s serial killer).<br />Anyway Mr. Allen may be persona non grata but Prime offered up his first digitally filmed movie — about the Jazz Age and the clubs and all the spending and glamour before the Crash.<br />Woody’s love of his insular culture — always staring infidelities and very blonde females, and never any Blacks, (I’m Black) so watching is like voyeuristic PR Anthropology with a jazz score.<br />Steve Carrell is completely brilliant of course; (they had fired my favorite actor Bruce Willis for misbehavior).<br />Plus I thought I would give Jesse Eisenberg a chance. He starred in Social Contract — as awful a film as I had ever seen. Like “Glitter” or “Gigli” or “Norbit”.<br />But Eisenberg’s flat effect and rapid speech works out great. That mature and tragic face of yearning is priceless, even beautiful. ‘The weight of the known world is on my shoulders.’<br />Edit: . . . An interesting character study, if you can bear to look at him, after the HBO film called: ‘Allen v. Farrow’."

Ok movie 🎥 glad I bought it due to the fact that I will need to watch more than once to pick up on the busy script and many many characters cast! Blu-ray Tm disc picture quality/clarity fluctuated wildly.going as low as 14 MBPS (less than 1/2quality of some BD)

"Guy Ritchie makes a decent film. I know tons of folks will tell you that snatch or lock stock were supposedly like his masterpieces or something. But no. Just no. I never liked them at all Sam I am. Those films were all style, and far too little substance for me. Now obviously loads of people go in for that sort of thing, take pretty much any Tarantino film for example. I just kinda always felt that Ritchie was like the British Tarantino.<br /><br />But this film shows a marked improvement in the overall quality of his story telling skill. Which frankly I didn't think was possible, but Mr. Ritchie has proven me wrong, and seems to actually be becoming a better film maker!<br /><br />It's not perfect. Just much better than his previous efforts. I now earnestly look forward to see what he does next.<br /><br />Granted if it weren't for McConaughey this would most likely be a total fail. But even as far as Matthew's films go this one ranks fairly decently. I'd say not quite as good as Interstellar or Wolf of Wall street, but still better than Beachbum or Serenity, and I consider the latter to actually be somewhat of a work of genius. Nevertheless MM's performance here is perhaps slightly more nuanced.<br /><br />So kudos to Mr. Ritchie for putting this all together. May he keep getting better and better. 🤞 (Fingers crossed just basically means that we pray for the best of luck.) He may be our last hope, given the current trajectory of Hollywood.<br /><br />What I really wanna see is a new James Bond directed by Guy Ritchie, and starring Tom Cruise. Now that would really be something special."

"He's done it again!! 😀😂😂  Absolutely the funniest comedy as only THE Bill Cosby can tell it!!  Just when you think he can't have anymore stories to tell about our  Interpersonal Relationships with our Loved Ones; here, in his own brilliant way, Cosby hilariously explains the true reality of Love, Marriage, &amp; Family from his own Life Experiences. So many times I identified my own Family Members (including myself) in his scenarios, which ALWAYS makes these skits even funnier!<br /><br />I've been wanting to Order this video for a long time--and after watching it I can confidently say, it was well worth every penny AND MORE!  I truly loved it!"

"I tried not to watch anything before the 2016 election. While others thought Hillary was absolutely going to be the winner I had a bad feeling that Trump would. Most of the beginning of this documentary was a surprise to me.<br />Mr. Moore is very thorough in his blame for Trump.<br />I for one will try not to be an ineffective dweeb, and if you don't believe me I will fistfight you in the street. 😂<br />You'll understand this more after watching.<br />I laughed, I cried and I finished with a queasy feeling. I think this is a must watch."

"I am no huge Afleck fan, and really prefer him as Batman 😁 , but I will say, this is a good movie. Though the back and forth in time kind of made me figure it out, it is still a very suspenseful movie, well scripted and BA did very well with his character! I give this a 5 ⭐ rating bc this movie is worth your time, and you will not regret this purchase...if you're a Afleck fan or not !"

The Polar Express that I ordered and received  today only had 1 DVD.  How ever there are supposed to have two DVD 📀<br />I bought this because my grandson is home from covid.  His class 3rd grade went to see this movie in the theater.<br />So as a surprise I was going to set our big screen up like at the movies. I'm glad that I did not tell him my surprise.  He had already cried because he couldn't go with his class.<br />I'm very let down my self.

"This movie has all the star talent, and lots of awesome bands on the soundtrack.  There are funny parts and technically some boobies.  I do think the party 🥳 is epic.  Unfortunately I regret buying it... It's technically a chick flick.  They should have called it Bachelorette Party because they go to a male strip club.  The director admits he wanted it to be a love story in the interview.  They never go to a strip club with ladies.  You could say that I am upset 😡 that for all the huge money budget this sex comedy had it fails to deliver.  My favorite sex comedies are Screwballs 1 and 2, Private School, Hot Dog, Zapped, Up the Creek, Hardbodies, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Pacific Banana, Weird Science, School Spirit, The Last American Virgin, Spring Break, Fraternity Vacation, Private Resort, Hot Resort, Animal House, Blame It On Rio, Hot T Shirts, The Party Animal except for the N word scene, and One Night Only except for the cousin part."

"My husband and I saw the big short and I have to say that Wow !! I know that I said the spotlight was a heavy weight for best picture but the big short was the best film I since about financial crisis of 2008 since front line did a story about the Madoff scandal. This movie explain it to us like 2 year old. Basically its about disturbing look at how wall street gamble on the housing market making people believe they can afford mortgage payments on a house they can't afford and as a result the people who gamble against the economy were the winners but in the moral sense some felt guilty knowing that economy is at its worst and at the end people lost their homes and even their lives as we seen in the news where people have killed enitre families because they can't support their families financial needs. While others in the movie didn't care at all as long as they got their bonuses for helping their companies get rich. As ryan g. Character said in the movie I never said I was the hero of the story...So very true .<br /><br />The performances are amazing to watch especially from brad pitt , bale, Ryan g. And the man of the hour was steve carell he should be nominated for this brilliant work as a man who was like the comedian from watchmen, he told the truth and was not afraid of letting people know it and when the opportunity to get back at the system by letting the world the truth that the mortgage crisis far worst and no one knows or seem to care as long as they got rich get more 💵💴💷💸💱💹💲💰💳👛💲💱💸💸💷💶 I think you get the point.<br /><br />This is a movie that should be shown to even school on earth as well as banks and wall street. Now there are some lessons to be learned but what is important is that this can never happen again or can it remember its all about the 💵?<br /><br />Buy this movie its worth a penny.😉<br /><br />👍best picture of 2016 and that cast is amazing. Brad get ready for another Oscar for producing."

Worth watching ~ decent b rate casting ~ it seems an awful lot like the story in non stop to me ~ trivial but... every time that you had to read something on the screen your given 1/2 the time to do so (rewind city) a rare Blu -ray crystal clear picture clarity holding very steady in the mid 30’s MegaBitsPerSecond 👀 again trivial but this kind of stuff is getting out of hand: 11mins36seconds of previews & advertisements prior to the movie followed by 1:25 of credits! Come on suits curb the corporate greed!

"I loved this book as a child and remember watching the movie at school. I was excited to see this in the $3.75 bin at Walmart and put it in my 7 year old daughter’s Easter basket. Unfortunately, it is NOT appropriate for children. This would be a wonderful movie had they left out the bad language and the little boys looking at porn. My teacher must have fast forwarded that part! That’s 80’s movies for you though. 🙄 I would love for them to remake it."

One of the greatest films I’ve seen. Been wanting this on dvd since I saw it in 2014. My sister & I really love it and know the entire dialogue! 😁 The package came unharmed and there was a little bit fingerprints on the DVD but I didn’t affect the movie!

"This is a cute movie.  I saw this movie in the late 80's on tv.  I really loved this movie and it was very hard to get because it was only released in Europe and another language.  Imagine my surprise when my mother and I were talking about this movie and I looked it up, ordered it and now I have it in my grubby hands😣😀👏👏👏"

"I love Dudley Moore. Hate to give a low star review, but, wasn't funny. Off sense of humor. The supporting actors didn't give much support . Almost like producers held his acting ability back and wouldn't allow him to be himself. But, good movie for Dudley fans. 🙂"

"Upon opening the Dvd case, i found it was punctured on back which caused a scratch on the back. End result the disk stops playing. Very disappointing. No hole in the amazon package. Otherwise arrived on time and in otherise good condition 👌"
"Sadly I have to return as there is NO movie no the disc!!!!! Sorry, but I won’t try ordering again just to possibly end up with the same issue 😔"
I loved this movie. If I could give it 10 stars I would. I can't tell you how many times I watched it. I just bought the Blu Ray version after watching it on Netflix. I watched the special features part and wished that all the deleted scenes were in the movie. I know they have to edit the movie but I would 've liked to be able to buy the movie without any deleted scenes. Just my opinion. The only drawback is that the soundtrack doesn't have all the songs that were in the movie. This is my NEW favorite movie 😎😎😎

Not as good as expected. I should waited until it is out on TV 😥. I'm a big minion fan and really not happy with the movie.

They always want to watch this. It arrived on time, in excellent condition & it was reasonably price. The quality of the movie is great & the plot is awesome. I give “Minions” movie 5🌟 out of 5! Another hit in our home!"

"Have always loved this movie, it was my 1st sci-fi movie as a little girl always wanted to go Devil's tower just to check it out. Finally made it there,  but no aliens. 👽😞😞😞 😀😀😆I did end up with a nice alien coffee mug for my office."

You will fall In Love with this little mouse and his adventure. I highly recommend for both children and adults of all ages. It's a keeper😀

"This was a good movie but I could only give it ONE star instead of 5 because it could have been a whole lot better BUT this guy,.. spent more time on his  satellite phone talking to his wife IN A COMBAT..!! situation ..AND NOT focusing on protecting his Marines ...and that's why some of them WENT HOME IN BODY BAGS .and THAT  IS  NOT HOW YOU DO THE JOB THAT YOU  were TRAINED for..so..that doesn't set well with this U.S MARINE.. if you want to talk to your loved ones.. or for that matter SEE, your loved ones again.. he should have truly WAITED !! until he  was back at base standing down..SO<br />it only gets ONE star from me..AND THAT,..IS NOT GOOD..👎👎👎👎<br />Because its not about the life's you take..its about the life's your saving..in a<br />Combat situation..."

Great movie 🎥 can for once almost agree with Amazon’s star ⭐️ rating! I understand out of the respect for the family reasoning but just feel that the ending was weak and incomplete & should be re thought out

Love this movie need a lot of tissues 😭 just to watch. Such a great melodrama.😢 So awesome yet so tragic and heartbreaking. The Titanic of the 1930s.

"🍎 Funny 🍎 As 🍎 Hell 🍎<br />Dark comedy is my favorite type, and Applesauce is a 7 or maybe even an 8 in darkness on a black comedy scale of 1-10. It takes a few minutes to become acclimated to the indie vibe and to realize that some of the humor is subtle or even intellectual, but once you get there you're off to the races. The story builds around two middle-aged Big Apple couples who seem reasonably happy before they have dinner together and a question comes up: &#34;What's the worst thing you've ever done?&#34; Circumstances go from bad to worse, with severed body parts and eventually a death entering the equation.<br /><br />Applesauce writer and director Onur Tukel also portrays husband #1 (Ron). The actors were impeccably cast. If like me you find NYC chix who wear glasses to be irresistible, then you'll be overjoyed by Trieste Kelly Dunn as wife #1 (Nicki) and Jennifer Prediger as wife #2 (Kate). Husband #2 (Les) is played by Max Casella, who has been in front of the camera since back to the Doogie Howser years. Numerous other characters (the actors also well chosen) further enrich the plot, but these four are the ones who drive the narrative.<br /><br />Ron is a schoolteacher who likes to challenge his students with what many would view as contrarian if not radical ideas (possibly relating to his Turkish heritage, which in itself is the source of some humor when up against the Italian Les). Applesauce pokes fun at the four central characters (especially the husbands for being so childish) while also allowing us to laugh with them and not just at them. The instability of the marriages and the resultant chaos are far more cringe-worthy than the severed body parts.<br /><br />4.5 stars, not quite 5 because Applesauce is sometimes too self-conscious (and perhaps even self-congratulatory), but if you like black humor and dislike happy endings, this is your cup of poison."

"The book is a miracle and the movie is a treasure💜💜💜<br /><br />André Aciman is an artist w his words.<br />Luca Guadagnino is an artist w his film.<br />Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer are artists in their genuine, joyful embodiment of Elio and Oliver."

"This is a beautiful film with stellar acting and gorgeous scenery.  Northern Italy is the idyllic setting, and Elio is at the heart of this story.  In comes Oliver, a 24 year old young man who is working/studying under Elio’s dad, Sam Perlman, who has a student live with the family each summer.  Elio appears to be both drawn to and conflicted about Oliver from the first, with his easy confidence and handsome American charm.  Everyone seems to love Oliver, and Elio eventually realizes that his feelings are much deeper than the superficial friendliness that he’s harbored for the previous “usurpers” of his room for six weeks of every summer.<br /><br />I was astounded by Elio, at once sophisticated and innocent, unsure about his awakening feelings and sexuality in one moment, yet confident and filled with bravado the next.  This is about first love in its purest form, beautifully acted and embodied by both lead actors.  There is definitely sexuality/sensuality but none of it is gratuitous: the first fumblings of the act as well as the deep earnestness of love.  There is some nudity and there are strong implications of various sexual acts.  It’s all beautifully done.<br /><br />The beauty of the relationship transcends everything.  This beauty is not limited to just Elio and Oliver, however, as Elio’s parents are amazing in their unconditional love and support.  His dad’s monologue brought me to tears.  It’s so full of tenderness and understanding.  The friendship Elio has with Marzia is also wonderful in its simple acceptance.<br /><br />This movie touched me on a fundamental level.  I can’t remember the last time a film moved me as this one did.  The actors and movie all deserve accolades and recognition for their work, but especially Timothée.  He is absolutely fabulous and it is an Oscar worthy performance.  Whoever cast this did an excellent job since the chemistry between Armie and Timothée is wonderful, as well as Elio’s parents.  If you can, watch it in theaters at least once.  You’ll appreciate the wide shots and cinematography better, not to mention the music.  Then you can savor it on the small screen when it’s released on video.  I’ve watched it twice so far.  Still awesome.  Bottom line, see this movie.  Loved loved loved.<br /><br />CMBYN has been nominated for the following Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (yay!!), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Song.  Not bad, but I’m disappointed that Luca isn’t nominated for Best Director and that neither Armie Hammer nor Michael Stuhlbarg are nominated for Supporting Actor.  At least one of these three guys should have been.  I’m really pulling for Timothée Chalamet for his amazing performance but all signs are pointing to Gary Oldman 😕.  Hopefully, the Academy will get it right.<br /><br />On to another issue.  There have been some detractors due to the age difference between the characters.  Elio is 17 to Oliver’s 24, but as I commented to a negative reviewer, Elio is a gifted, sophisticated young man, and although he may have less life experiences than Oliver when they meet, he seems more in tune emotionally than Oliver is at the beginning of the story.  They connect deeply on an emotional level because they are each other’s first emotional surrender.  Think of it this way.  There are many gifted people out there who probably did not connect with their peers due to their giftedness while growing up (or even as adults).  Elio is sort of the same way.  They stimulate each other intellectually, emotionally, and sensually.  Do I think this age difference would work for everyone?  No, but it certainly does here because of Elio’s overall maturity and his cosmopolitan lifestyle.  I just wanted to mention this because there are some people, albeit not many, who are very much missing the point of this story and are fixated on a non-issue.<br /><br />This is a story of love: romantic, familial, platonic, in a gorgeous setting.  Simply let yourself get lost in it and just feel.  And hopefully, it will open up your heart and your mind to... well, everything.<br /><br />Favorite movie of the year (or maybe ever) and one that will stand the test of time."

I give Savannah smiles a fabulous rating love this movie! I purchased it because I wanted in Blue Ray. How ever this copy of the movie into Blue Ray and DVD is not a good one at all.  I watched the beginning of it in the Blue Ray and DVD and Compared it to my DVD I’ve had for a while. Frankly the DVD I purchased years ago is clearer than the Blue Ray I just got yesterday.  😭😭😭

But I’m still very excited to have this movie released on Blu-ray  - Very touching movie makes me cry every time..😇💙💙💙😇 Rest in paradise Bridgette Anderson God bless her cotton socks. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💐💐💐

I luv'd both movies. The cinematography was fantastic. I liked the special effects also. My only problem is what happened to the 1st girl from the 1st movie he was soooooo in love with. I thought I would see a continuation if their live story.<br /><br />Also the woman in the pit who was his actual mother in the 1st one doesn't seem to be in this one. Nor the woman who adopted him from below the mountain.<br /><br />In the 1st movie the guy who is his sidekick/companion/protector admitted to killing his father.  Now in this movie he is ok with Baahubali. Confusing. But overall its real entertaining & glad I am watching it.<br /><br />Silly me I get it now.  THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME😀
I luv'd both movies. The cinematography was fantastic. I liked the special effects also. My only problem is what happened to the 1st girl from the 1st movie he was soooooo in love with.

"I Bought this Movie by Mistake bc I Thought it was Another Movie of Christopher Reeve, Above Suspicion. I was Wondering Why it had Daryl Hannah & Not Kim Cattral🤔 But it Turned Out to be a Fabulous & Entertaining! I Miss the Late Christopher Reeve and He Did an Outstanding Job as Always 🙏❤️"

I had not heard of this movie..infact I went to BIG LOTS..to see what movies they had for $5.00 or less..and I saw this sitting on the shelf with other Blu-ray movies for sale. So I picked it up and looked at it and then put it back..and continued looking for something good..and then I came back around to this movie again..and picked it up and this time it kinda caught me eye..<br />STALLONE VS DE NIRO..so I said to myself..ok..let's give it a shot..<br />And man..I was truly glad I did..<br />This movie is crazy funny..and heart warming..and truly 10 times better then I thought it would be..<br />..and I still don't know how I didn't hear about this movie..I guess that's what happens at old age..hahahaha..you start missing out some things..but I'm glad that I didn't miss this one..because it's great..and worthy to add to your collection..you will not be disappointed..and I give it 5 big stars..Enjoy..😊😊👍👍👍👍👍❤<br />And the special features are great..and you have great actors and a great script..

🔺️PROS......Lots of spectacular CGI action...plot fair.....what little acting is ok.<br /><br />🔺️CONS & Other Comments  .....Not much acting by real people....with CGI......producers can throw out logical actions and thoughts many times. Last time I saw Kong he was only approx 30 stories tall....they must have given him mucho steroids since...he is as tall as Godzilla in this one. One laugher is both are standing on an aircraft carrier without it sinking!!!...like I said with CGI....one can forget what is logical. Other monsters in this get approx 2 minutes of screen time total...with more for the man made Godzilla towards the end and even it gets dispatched rather quickly when both G & K team up together. One big battle between the two...sleight edge to Godzilla.....would be no match if G would have hit K with his nuclear breathe though. Good movie....you will enjoy....although I liked the previous Godzilla movie better. I do not know what actors got paid for such little acting in a big movie release.

I bought this DVD used. It said it was in very good shape. As I was watching it it stopped playing three different times. I would say that’s not in very good shape. I will not buy anything used from Amazon again.🤬

"I have to say this movie is......<br /><br />AMAZING!.. Tears and all, sadness and happiness, I cannot start to explain how well written the story is. Great for kids and parents, the only thing I regret is not seeing it sooner.<br /><br />I have never wrote a review for a movie before now, and I have written this because I am reading bad reviews/ratings. People keep comparing it to other pixar films,  yes it is different in the way characters were drawn, but it makes it UNIQUE.<br />I watched 'the good dinosaur' Today on Xfinity, not knowing what to expect as I had not looked at any reviews and I had only watched a 30 second trailer...<br />So, before it started I was slightly sceptical, thinking that it was going to be very kiddish! Then the film started.. through most of the film, my daughters and I were in tears! (My husband looked sooo into the movie too very focused on the story) It is the most heartwarming, emotional, animated film I have watched and it really touched my heart, some of the scenes in the film were so brilliantly thought out to show real messages! There was one scene where I was in floods of tears, the scene dealt with a serious theme, but did it so brilliantly! (you'll know what I mean if you watch it!) At the end our eyes were still watering! (Of a good warm feeling)<br /><br />All I am saying is do not listen to the bad reviews. Most of them will be expecting something complex but, this film is really not about that! This film is inspiring! Especially for children! It is a simple film, but the subtle messages, such as overcoming your fears, the importance of family, and making your mark were heartwarming, and make you think, a lot!<br />And for those reviews that said the film scared their child? Well, I mine did cry at 2 important points, first of sadness and throughout the film they were asking questions, laughing, and full of excitement! And the second was by the ending but of happiness.  This film was very funny, but emotional at the right times, with a great plot that really makes you think! I loved this film a lot more than other Pixar films such as wall-E, Up or Toy Story. Yes, I know that these films have imaginative, classic plots, but this film teaches you a lot more than they do, and also makes you feel for the characters! So go ahead and watch! But don't listen to the bad reviews! You will be wanting to write against the bad reviews as well. 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿"

Why they would promote same sex marriage with one of the a star trek lead actors was truly a disappoint..and now they have truly lost me as a life long fan of star trek..And im sure..that They do not care..but that has definitely killed star trek..for me..because now..I will not be able to look at SULU in the same way in ANYMORE in star trek ..because of this last movie..<br />And that's a shame because I really liked star trek from the tv..to the big screen..But..not any more..I probably could have accepted anything else but that..but it just made me feel sick..so....good bye star trek..it was better when ALL of you we're straight..at least on star trek..you're private life is your own..and don't get me wrong..<br />I don't hate gay people..I forgive them..because they know not..what they do..🙏

"The reboots are still working, great casting & story! (Even though the jokes are quite obvious?) Simon Pegg did a great job on the script, the direction was also slightly obvious as well at times? Not a huge fan on Justin Lin, or his style, but I still managed to truly love this movie! Cast works fantastic off each other, almost as good, as the original cast! (But will they ever stop destroying the Enterprise??)😎😎😎"

"There’s no better brilliant representation of Jesus than Robert Powell  ‼️👍🏼 He captured the humanity of Jesus (which is rarely shown) in other versions of his life. His love & deep compassion for everyone. His last minute struggles to accept the terrible sacrifice that was to come.<br />Ian McShane was incredible as Judas. He was able to show the confusion,struggle & agony Judas went through trying to do what he thought was the best. The terrible moments realizing he had led his Friend & Master to his death.<br />All the Actors, Zifferlli’s masterful directing & the Production of the series SENSATIONAL ‼️‼️‼️<br />A MUST SEE👍🏼‼️‼️"

"Lies about what it includes! No sing a long, no music video, no digital copy. None of that. It's pretty much just the movie and some deleted scenes, I didnt even click that though. I was so happy for the music videos cause my daughter loves the soundtrack. Will def be returning and it says disc MADE IN MEXICO...what? Knock off version😡"
Price was attractive... 2 of the discs had errors that froze display. Particularly The Stratton Story. I played them on different players..same spots they froze. Guess I just got a lemon.....🍋

"The Sting may be the movie I have seen more than any other from start to finish (surpassing Jaws).<br />After having already appeared together as Butch and Sundance, Newman and Redford were catapulting to living legendary status as they were cast in The Sting; with Robert Shaw (kinda funny to me Shaw in Jaws also…) appropriately cast as the Irish mobster Lonigan (it sure ain’t Lindeman) the villain who hates to lose:<br />‘What was I supposed to do?  Accuse him of cheating better than me?!”<br />This is a no-brainer 5 star review that does not need much explaining because I’m quite confident the far majority of you reading this have already seen this classic 1973 movie with the great 1930’s, Southside of Chicago sets, and the memorable Scott Joplin/Marvin Hamlisch score (even if the music is—in truth—not correct for the era).<br />Which brings me to the extras which is quite good.  Plenty of interviews with Newman and Redford, screenwriter David Ward (wanted Big Bill Broonzy music in movie…), Ray Walston (tells a great story about director George Roy Hill simply solving the problem of Robert Shaw's walk in the movie … Shaw was ready to leave!), and Eileen Brennan who also gets to explain the genesis of her ‘walk’ in the movie.<br />The 3 part documentary is 55 minutes long.<br /><br />So this is an easy purchase.  The Sting a flat out very entertaining classic.  My 2012 DVD Universal pic is widescreen.  Sound is fine.<br />35 MM print digitally remastered.<br />The Sting won 7 academy awards for good reason.<br />Perfect score … even though the music is 30 years too old😉<br />Just to clarify:  screenwriter Ward DID agree the music chosen by director Hill was correct."

It’s a beautiful story about what I believe is a real Miracle. At four years of age this Child could not have made his experience up. There’s an excellent interview by the young man this happened too. I Believe this Miracle 🙏🕊

"Ok, let me start hy saying I hate Disney's grabby money grubbing paws. But! Encanto is a dream movie. It breaks stereotypes by letting male and female characters to exist without the salvation of a romantic relationship. The music is addictive (I can only listen to ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" twice a day at work 😂 per co-worker request) the animation is reminiscnt of Don Bluth in a 3D format: detail oriented with beautiful swoops of movement. Each actor is on point with expression and the animation reflects that. It's an exquisite experience, worth repeating and sharing. First Disney movie I've ever bought."

"Really cute rom-com from 1987 that still holds up in 2022. Kim Basinger,  Jeff Bridges and the incomparable Rip Torn are all excellent.  It's a simple movie (no modern flash) set in the 50s. I enjoyed the charisma Jeff and Kim shared.  And it's currently free on Prime Video as of 10/1/22 👍🏻👍🏻"

"I loved that movie so much and when I saw that Amazon had it on 4K, I bought it at full price. I specifically got it on Amazon and not a vendor because those vendors have a lot of bootlegs. But unfortunately, Amazon gave me a bootlegged movie at full price. I am so disappointed in Amazon 🤨! I thought with the 4K is going to be really great but it was not at all. There wasn't any brighter, deeper more lifelike color and all. And the movie kept on skipping over and over and over again ugh. 🙁"

I picked this up back in November 2022. I was looking forward to seeing the video with my husband on February 14th 2023. I was extremely disappointed to find that I had been taken. The video appears to be blank. 😳 the vedio will not play on any of my (3) Blue-Ray DVD players. I bought this in good faith and now I'm feeling like a sap that got taken. If I could I would give this Company a-5 rating.

My husband and I saw both of eli Roth's films in the theater as part of a Halloween night out. I have to say my hubby had a real weak stomach for the green inferno I loved them both . I really love this movie especially kenau power house performance. I have to say that its a question of who is the victim or who is being raped. A lot of people always say a man can't be raped by a woman. Its not always common BC the news report women as victims of rape or the only time you hear rape of a man is he is raped in jail or in ⛪. This was a interesting story about 2 sexual deviants who behavior is so out of control that you wonder if you want to help a total stranger you don't know. It is a funny movie and has it eli Roth's moments of chills . its not like hostel which is my favorite . its eli trying different things like black comedy.<br /><br />It does have a amazing cast. I am not saying that crimes against women is not important or wrong. I think that eli is looking at the taboo of the situation.<br />There is alot of nudity and it does have a funny ending. Its also funny watching kenau yelling.  So if you are looking for a good thriller by this for a penny and don't listen to the haters 💀😂<br /><br />Its a A++ its different for eli but I perfer his gory horror movies.

"Love Robert Downey Jr. !!!! 💖 great movie, except for the deception that the real mandarin, (not revealed til the end of the film) made you believe the fool he hired for the act, (Ben Kingsley) which made for a good convincing, terroristic maniac, completely threw me off. That was a little upsetting. 😕 other than that, great. Best iron man movie I've seen so far!"

"I'm a big fan of Robin Williams in Drama,Comedy, and Stand-up. His performance in Dead Poets Society was amazing with a dramatic touch, in a powerful departure from his comedic roles. This is my fifth 🎥 from the late Mr. Williams."

"What a cute movie 🎥 ! Great soundtrack 🎶 , too. Funny Jewish family. Light-hearted romantic comedy. A welcome ray of sunshine ☀️  during these less than fun times. Very current with LGBT element. Breathtaking views of Malibu Beach. And speaking of breathtaking, who’s that hot 🔥 best friend, “Chris” on the basketball court, at the wedding and on the beach. I think his name is PAUL GENNARO 👀!"

"I got the Blu-ray Discs and the first movie played fine. I put the second one in (Ralph Breaks the internet) and it immediately freezes on Ralph when I put it in. See picture. The player stops responding to all commands and I have to unplug the power to get it working again. I did an exchange because I thought it might be the one I had, nope! Same problem on the new discs.

"It's hard for a movie to follow an outstanding book, but some do a good job at it.  This one was disappointing for me.  One thing I didn't care for in the least was the voice of the dog, it was a monotonous, gravelly, boring one without any emotion, which didn't fit in.  I don't know where in the hell they came up with that or what they were thinking.  No comparison to say, the voice in A Dog's Purpose. 👎"

"This review is for Fantastic Beasts..not sure why the reviews for the Harry Potter Set are mixed in with these, kind of annoying. Anyway, I love this movie! Not as much going on visually as in the HP movies but still very enjoyable. What I love about this movie are the actors and the Beasts. Eddie Redmayne, Alison Sudol and especially Dan Folgler (which was sort of surprising) made me love their characters. The visual effects were super and the music was beautiful. I have watched this movie, literally, 20 times and I still cry at the end! 😁"

"It was fun, and entertaining. Beautiful<br />actors too--some faves. ) 💃 I really came to add  to my review of TLAM Too--I didn't like the movie, but have to add, I cut back on the movie, at the end, and it was very cute--and the men (and women)  growing up and stronger is always the best part to me.  (And please don't say chick flick, that's ew haha). A Chi-Flick also means it teaches about women -- and that's a NEEDED THING!!!  Peace 🎥"

"So many critics, and editors have discredited this film, for no reason. It is one of my favorite Vincent Price movies, after Dr. Goldfoot. In so many of his movies, the explanation of the cause of the problem that he comes up with, somehow, kinda, makes sense. (No, I don't do drugs, smoke or drink) To this day, I hate doors and windows that open and close by themselves. Never come up behind me, I will swing whatever I'm holding, or can reach.  RIP Vincent. You are missed. Hugs to all fellow fans! 😍"

"I loved this version of Snow White as a child; the scenery is beautiful, the story is enchanting, and the costumes are gorgeous. I was so excited to purchase this movie, only to be disappointed when the message “Region Error” popped up on my TV after installing the disc into my DVD player. I did some research, and apparently, when DVDs are made, they are only compatible with DVD that have the same “region code”. There are 9 region codes in total. The United States/Canada (where I live) uses region code #1 for DVDs, and DVD players distributed here will only play movies that also use region code #1. The DVD copy I received however, has region code #2 (which is used in Japan, Europe, South Africa, the Middle East, and Greenland). This fact was not made aware to me when purchasing this product, and I am now left with a movie that will not play on any of my devices 🥺."

I own a huge Disney library and all of Star Wars well most of it of these spin offs I have bought a few but I really liked this one . But I doubt I'll be buying anymore I'm not really thrilled they are producing so many new movies and watering down the franchise. Just like Star Trek and Doctor Who I've got thousands of dollars in these franchises and I haven't watched some of the new some not at all it makes me sad and mad that they have destroyed some of the oldest Sci Fi Series that have ever been created. But this one about Hans Solo I liked alot even though it seems to not be getting great ratings seems like I'm always on the wrong side of the ratings🤷

"I liked the film itself fine.  What I didn't like was paying for a NEW bluray when it was obviously USED.  I watched my husband RIP off the cellophane wrapping and pop it into our player. FIRST THING it asks if we want to RESUME from the last time! Yeah,  that's not new. Been repackaged and resealed.😑😡🤬"

I watched this on another venue and it was just OK! It is extremely well cast with Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman in the main roles. I hated the kid that played Martin. What did he use to make both of the kids sick? They couldn’t find out? Seriously? The best guy in the country just couldn’t figure it out? How did Martin reverse the disease? Makes no sense at all. And he (Martin) gets away with it? Three Luke warm stars for the casting of Farrell/Kidman. The only good thing about this movie. 🎥

And he (Martin) gets away with it? Three Luke warm stars for the casting of Farrell/Kidman. The only good thing about this movie. 🎥
The best Christmas movie ever.  The sad part is it is hardly ever shown on TV and when it is it is at 3:am.<br />I missed it this year! 😔

This movie is a great movie to sit down and watch and disect the absolute insanity of how you can either destroy a movie with its special effects and acting or create a work of art....this movie manages to do both somehow and it will definitely become a personal favorite after multiple views....(the car driving cut scenes where it goes from daytime to night time are priceless🤣🤣🤣)....if anyone likes this movie watch Tommy Wiseau's The Room next....

"Weekend Feature! Never seen it ♥️♥️♥️💐<br />No spoilers please !!<br /><br />Update: I like this movie and Don Juan DeMarco even better. Johnny and Faye Dunaway in both. This one also has another love interest, the daughter of his lover. So<br />It’s fraught with love entanglements. Interesting group of people. Everyone with their own dream.<br />I will tell you my two fav parts but not elaborate so I don’t ruin it for you:<br />1. Doll on a music box<br />2. When Johnny is a chicken"

I have seen a lot of gangsta movies in my time like scarface godfather good fellas king of new York and my favorite once upon a time in america . all great films but black mass is a chilling tale and new gangster classic .<br /><br />Why this is a chilling story BC what  the FBI did which is nothing to stop whitey from his crimes. In this movie he didn't seem to care who he killed as long as they were not a threat to him. You will see in the movie that a serial killer and the feds working to together and gave him a license to kill it makes you sick.<br /><br />Johnny depp had always played great parts in movies but this is the scariest performance since Javier B.🔫🔪💣 in old country for old men. Johnny shows us that this monster is exactly what he is and instead of being repulse  by this man you become fanasinated as to why he is the way he is . how one person can have s love for the neighborhood and then a cold blooded killer the next moment. I guess I will have to buy on amazon the sociopath next door (book) to understand or we just will never understand the complexity of whitey. Johnny does an amazing job as well as Joel e. Did a brilliant job as the FBI agent who let him get away with it as the informant while not realizing that he is just as bad as whitey because he did nothing to stop him . it'd like the movie departed some have said its based on whitey case . either way this movie is classic gangster drama its very violent very brutal and most of all a chilling look at our system and who is protecting who. I thought the FBI is supposed to protect us not the criminals.<br /><br />Brilliant acting from the cast.🎭<br />This a must have 📀 collection<br /><br />As for the FBI helping whitey shame on you😵😕😡<br /><br />A±++++++ amazing movie

"These are 3 fun and entertaining movies that should be in anyone's collection. As far as the 4k transfers, they are very good.  The dark scenes are much better and less muddy than the former bluray and the colors are spectacular. The only draw back is some of the CGI shows it's age in 4k. Still there are alot of practical effects that looks good so it's not often that your noticing it. With the movies being from the late 90's to early 2000's some of that is to be expected.  Overall all I give them 👍👍."

Great movie 🍿 ending & performance by mr hanks! Would have given a 5 star rating if not for the sub standard picture quality/ clarity!! Of the Blu-ray Tm disc which clocks in at the low to mid 20’s MegaBitsPerSecond when a higher quality disc is 32-35 MBPS🙈👀🤮🤏

"Anthology horror films have displayed some clearly interesting, weird, stunning & horrific stories to tell, & 1995’s ‘Tales From the Hood’ is no exception: featuring a quartet of disturbing stories ranging from a dead man’s desire to exact vengeance on those who wronged him, supernatural terrors that prove big terrors come in small packages, plus a man’s battle over his own conscience. Clarence Williams III (who unfortunately passed away this year on June 4th at age 81) gives a powerfully creepy performance as mortician Mr. Simms, proving that even the dead can tell tales. If you enjoy the likes of ‘Creepshow’ & ‘Trick R Treat’, you will definitely dig this anthology of tales from the ‘hood! 😈👹👻💀"

It throws me off, I'm sure my 2yr could care less, but it is still weird. $40 for a 4 movie deal, but 1 of the movies has her name different. It's not Viana, it Moana. 😒"

These have been and always will be my favorite musicals. 🥰🥰 I searched every where for this movie in Walmart and finally decided I’m just going to order it off Amazon.

"A wonderful story, for kids and adults.  It has been one of my kids favorites since they were young. Now 30 years later, I bought it and watched it. I only cried about 4 different times. 😍😁🥰"

John Sayles can really tell a great story. Don't know what it is exactly......he draws you in and you really don't know what is going to happen next so you keep watching ALL THE WAY TO THE END.....cause you just never know what is going to happen next! That's pretty much it. You are completely immersed into a time a place......AND it's actually worth your time cause you come away with a pleasant feeling that the world isn't such a bad place....in fact some of it is quite magical and good. Please enjoy this movie for what it is.....you'll thank me later 🙂

"Just watched this on a Direct TV channel and I'm still in complete awe that 72 year old Jimmy Page, this old cat isn't ready for a rocking chair just yet. The only thing missing was a 5th of JD, but I'm quite sure there was quite a bit of things being passed around off camera. But just as I thought my music has passed to whatever they call it now, it's good to see that Blues, mixed in with a little old fashioned kick ass rock n roll, is still is cool 😎. Because this kind of music doesn't have to prove a damn thing to anyone. A 72 year old man is still Kickin ass even all of today's American Idol are barely hanging on to there dying careers. With Jack White fairly young, this music won't be phased out any time soon,,,"

"This DVD is a Region 2 DVD from the UK and doesn't work in any of my players!  I never even knew what a Region 2 disc was until a colleague helped figure out why it wouldn't play. This was meant for a class, so now I have the hassle of returning it and finding a disc to borrow in the meantime 😡😡😡.<br /><br />After searching, it seems that the Region 2 warning shows only on the order info. after the fact, so this was not my fault or mistake.  The product info. Is just missing when you buy.  I browsed all of Movie Mar's current offers, and no where does it say that the disc is a Region 2.<br /><br />Also, I am having trouble finding a reasonably priced 1968 Romeo and Juliet from anyone. Either the discs ship from abroad and are expensive or they are USED, not new, and there is no info. to verify that it's not a Region 2 disc!"

I love this movie so much! You see the defeat and struggle but its courageous and full of faith when you think there is no hope left for The Avengers. To be honest I was in tears in the end. 😥😄

This was always my favorite Disney movie as a child and my children learned to love it as well. It was a special treat to watch so beautifully restored. We wore out the VHS years ago! I must say my perspective has changed somewhat since seeing &#34;Maleficent&#34;  however 😊

"(This came with 3 discs: 1 DVD, 1 bluray, and 1 bluray with extras plus a digital code, all in new pristine packaging with no fingerprints on any disc. The digital code sheet says it's expired but it still worked when I used it with VUDU.) I'm very easy to please when it comes to certain types of movies and will give most movies a viewing if it strikes my fancy in any way. Note that I do not regularly read comics (other than on occasion The Walking Dead) but I love watching action and super hero/comic book movies and this movie has the right amount of action for me. I also love apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic/destruction movies and this did meet that as well for me. I did not at all expect such destruction. Personally I thought that was great and awe-inspiring. The fight scenes were great as well. The movie looked and sounded great on my small 1080p HD TV with cheap Sony 5.1 surround sound. I was a-ok with the darkness and I guess grayer/muted tone of the movie that some people seemed to hate. But then the brighter, lighter types of films such as most of Marvel's movies aren't my thing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them too but just not nearly as much (P.S. my faves are the X-men series especially the more recent ones). My only superman knowledge comes from the original Christopher Reeve movies, some cartoons, some episodes of Smallville, and Superman Returns so I can't really judge on it by it's comic book lore or lack of it. I wasn't too sure about Henry Cavill when I first heard about him being cast as Superman but after watching this once I admit he makes a great Superman. I'm content with his rendition. Overall I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. I found nothing annoying about it. It's not academy award winning but then I don't watch films for that. Movies are my escapism from reality and this met that very well. 2 thumbs up from me. 👍👍"

"Top Gun MAVERICK is the blockbuster of all blockbusters. The movie is produced perfectly from start to finish. Everything was perfectly delivered. The cinematography and visuals was really well researched and splendidly filmed with the perfect subject focus, correct angles and lighting effect. The writing and production was absolute perfection. The scripting was masterminded. The soundtrack is the best ever, beautiful and fits the scene and moods ideally. The casting was definitely on point with the perfect stars playing the ideal character.  The editing was amazing. Tom Cruise's supporting cast delivers a spectacular spot on performance. And see a few big egos get put in check along the way.  You will see character development and growth.<br />  The movie starts by playing the Top Gun Anthem, moving right into the Danger Zone while watching flight deck operations launching the powerful F-18 fighter jet. See the jets being catapulted 300 feet from zero to 165 mph in 2 seconds during launching. Hear their roar, and feel the rumble of the afterburners blazing fire as they're climbing skyward. With several cameras mounted in the cockpit of the jets, you feel like you are actually in the cockpit pulling G's, and making hairpin turns with the pilot . You may need a barf bag! 🤮 See the greatest flying scenes ever filmed. The movie is sheer excitement and suspense. You will be on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. The action is non-stop. You will see nail-biting, palm-sweating, and jaw-dropping action and adventure like never seen before. The excitement will leave you breathless, you will only be able to say,"" WOW ""😲. This movie really hits on the emotions. The movie features flashbacks from Top Gun 1 that will bring back plenty of nostalgia and emotional memories. This movie is put together so well. Phenomenal work!<br />  The scene where Val Kilmer makes a special guest appearance is very heart-warming and emotional because everyone loves Val Kilmer. Welcome back Val!! Thanks for all the great memories!! Special homage is given to the beloved Goose because everyone loves and misses him so much. Talk to me Goose! He remains with all of us in spirit.<br />  Seems nobody trusts or believes in Maverick. But watch him prove them all wrong. He puts all doubters in check.<br />  The final mission scene will certainly blow your senses away with intense and emotional scenes like explosions, crashes, and teamwork. Maverick's incredible dog-fighting skills and flying skills are put to the test. He pushes the jet to it's absolute limits with incredible evasive and aggressive maneuvers. This is an amazing action and adventure scene. The dog-fighting, and air-combat scenes are superbly filmed.  Your emotions will be on a wild rollercoaster ride. You will be laughing, next moment you are crying, then someone's cockiness, arrogance and big ego will really anger you. 😡🤬 This is a very emotional movie 😢 🍿.<br />  The movie even features a surprise hero, and the famous Maverick tower buzz.<br />  The closing scene is so beautiful and romantic with the perfect and meaningful song from Lady Gaga. Now Maverick can fly off into the sunset and live happily ever after!! A truly great ending with emotional flare!! Have a tissue handy!! 🥲<br />  This movie is a true Masterpiece. It was mentioned that this is possibly one of the best movies ever filmed. Even the movie critics are giving this film 👍👍.<br />  Special thanks go to the production crew for their undying effort and passion to give us the perfect production. Great job guys! This movie was definitely made with the fans in mind.  Thanks Tom!! You will want to watch this movie over and over again. This is one very exciting thrill ride you will thoroughly enjoy and never forget. So tighten your seat belts and prepare for takeoff. Experience the Danger Zone, courtesy of Captain Pete Mitchell. Call sign, MAVERICK!!<br />  There are already rumors about making a Top Gun 3. I don't see how anyone can possibly outdo Top Gun:MAVERICK. Hmmm, we'll see.<br />  Flying through the Danger Zone again? Talk to me Goose.<br /> I sincerely hope you enjoyed this DVD review, and found it helpful. Great quality, very entertaining! Recommend!"

"Not very good..CHLOE GRACE MORETZ..was ok..but was better in<br />The Equalizer.. with Denzel Washington..but in this alien invasion move it was more like watching a mini series debut.or like watching a new version of "" THE INVADERS ""...and not a good one at that..it just doesn't hit the mark..its to slow in spots..and not<br />Enough action..just another badly written movie..you see the spaceship in the sky as on the disc cover.. twice ..BUT THE ALIANS. IN THEIR TRUE FORM.look like baby face huggers..but invisible to the eye ..SO.<br />I COULD ONLY GIVE THIS MOVIE<br />ONE STAR...ITS.JUST ANOTHER BADLY MADE MOVIE..👎👎👎👎👎..<br />In fact..THIS MOVIE  MAKES THE MOVIE "" HORIZON LINE ""<br />A MUCH BETTER BUY..THEN THIS MOVIE..AND IF YOU HAVE WATCHED THAT MOVIE..YOU WILL TRULY KNOW WHAT I MEAN...😊😊😊..so in short..this movie is not worth the price being asked..$3.00..would be a better price..."

"First the movie plot was stupid and made no sense. Also, way the hell kill off Bond. What’s the future now a woman 😒007. Not that I have anything against women, 👀 Emma Peel from the Avengers is still my all time favorite. Can never be the same again for me."

"This was a sweet, tender movie about a family coming to terms with the last few months of a loved one. Set in 1950's (?) Norfolk this movie is simply outstanding. Jamie Dornan shines as Joe, a companion to the elderly Hannah. Although he has limited dialogue, he owns every scene he is in.<br /><br />This DVD is, in fact, a Region 2 DVD. When I bought it, it was fully disclosed that it would not play on MOST US DVD players. I converted an older laptop that has a DVD player to a Region 2 player. Since I have many Region 2 DVD's  it made sense to have something that will play Region 2 DVD's. I'm sorry so many reviews reflect negatively on the confusion over the region and NOT on the movie itself, which is Outstanding! Five tender stars on this one. 🐚🐚🐚🐚🐚"

"This movie was absolutely captivating! Not really similar to The Shape of Water, except it does involve a quasi-humanoid/aquatic race of beings! I'll not say much about it because, if you can see it, DO! Directed by Xavier Gens who gave us frontiere(s) and The Divide, this is his best movie yet! A nod to man's insensitivity to anything he doesn't understand, Cold Skin is both hauntingly beautiful, yet relentless...filled with rage, violence and horror. The effects are top-notch, as is the acting...it will keep you glued to your seat till the bloody end. Very Highly Recommended!<br />😸🎨🎸 Five skulls! 💀💀💀💀💀"

"Lol the reviews are so mixed. Combine them all and it's how I feel lol<br />I did NOT think the acting was bad. Story's been told before really, but it still entertained. Ridiculously unbelievable at time?  Absolutely<br />Corny dialogue?  Yepper<br />Great effects/storm/action...Yes<br />Not one I'd add to my collection, but worth the watch. Didn't suck. Wasn't great.<br /><br />Helpful review huh??  Hahaha<br />Watch for yourself and don't have high expectations 👍🏻"

"Movie and the Actors show what it is to be both in pain loosing someone and helping someone who is so much pain to be a friend when they can't see that is what is needed. Watching it shows what people go through daily,  and how to be comforted by a stranger you don't know!! In doing so there is a time to grieve and return to Love and Joy, Peace,to give to the next one hurting 💔..❤️❣️🙏😇"

The Steelbook is awesome. But it did not come with the “Exclusive Booklet” that it says it is supposed to come with. 🥺 Other than that it is an awesome edition to my Ghibli collection. Just wish it had the booklet.

"One of the best movies ever! I love it! So much so, that I went to buy it at our local Walmart...they didn't have it. Went to a couple of more in a nearby town...they didn't have it! Went to a Mckay's, they didn't have it! I ordered it from Amazon (should have done that to begin with!) and YES they had it! I got it within a few days! (Sigh 😊) The Holiday didn't come on this year around Christmas (that's when it usually does!) on any of the channels that I have! I was very disappointed...thus the frantic search for it! Cameron Diaz and Jude Law are so wonderful together! Cute story line! It's a &#34;snuggle on your couch with popcorn and Coke&#34; kinda movie!!! Love it!"

"Absolutely nothing to dislike about this movie. A warm, funny and captivating film starring a talented cast of characters. The setting is in a scenic Italian vineyard-dotted countryside, reminding me of Yamhill County, Oregon (USA) vineyards. 😍<br />Small town loyality among the townfolks (all ages) is sooo enduring that viewers will find themselves entwined with these characters.  I truly loved this movie ❤ and highly recommend.<br />I am a verfied buyer.<br />Linda,  Utah"

This movie stopped playing about half way. Was not a full recording. Maybe a fluke so I ordered a replacement. The second one stopped at the same spot😡😡. This seller does not deserve 1 star but I had to choose something. Such a SCAM!

We’ve already bought the soundtrack in digital and CD form. The cast did an excellent job of acting! I was pleasantly surprised to see quite a few unknown actors along with the bigger names like Jackman, Efron, Williams, and Zendaya. I have no doubt that these talented actors will be able to book a lot more jobs after this. The actresses who played the bearded lady and Jenny Lind have phenomenal voices. The dancing was wonderfully choreographed. I especially loved the acrobatics in the beautiful ballad Rewrite the Stars performed by Zac Efron and Zendaya. I can easily say this is a movie that my whole family will watch several times when we get the Blu-ray. If you like musicals, you won’t be disappointed! I do wish it was a little closer to the true story of P.T. Barnum (for example, even though Lind did quit the tour early, he made about $400,000 off her tour. That would be around $17 million in today’s currency. So it wouldn’t have really phased him that she quit.) I understand that wouldn’t have made for as good as lif a movie though without all the hardships. Also, yes there was a fire, but it was set for political reasons, and had nothing to do with peoples reactions to the “freaks”. You see the fire in the preview, so hopefully I’m not spoiling anything. 😉"

Sometimes you just need a good love story. This is one of the best!The story line just great . I'm pretty sure at some time or another we all thought that we would like to be  with someone and a twist of fate leads us to another 💓.

"I wanna start off by saying too many people on here think this is their own personal  movie 🎥 critics lounge 🍿 it’s actually a store where people come to buy products that’s what you’re given an actual product review not a movie review with that being said let’s get started. This review is for Shout! Factory collectors edition Blu-ray DVD of John Carpenter’s in the Mouth 👄 of Madness<br />It’s an excellent HD transfer and very good audio, it also has an assortment of special features check out my pictures above to see exactly what comes on the Blu-ray Disc.!!

Just like the movie title. Rust. I think I started to rust while watching it. I quickly had to get an oil can and loosen up my wife's joints because she almost became paralyzed from getting so rusty from watching it. Completely jaw droppingly confusing and disturbing from start to finish. I hope part 2 is called &#34;Oil&#34; because part 1 needs a lot of it. All throughout the movie my brain kept asking me why I was still watching it. Then the song 🎶If I only had a brain🎶 echoed through my mind. I just didn't have the heart to turn it off either. I felt so sorry for the director and cast that I felt I had to give them every chance possible to make sense of it all by the end of the film. But this just simply didn't happen. Finally I got the oil and was able to stop the rust formation long enough to put The Wizard of Oz in just so we could watch something that made more sense. Now that we endured this Rust phenomenon The Wizard of Oz suddenly seems like an intellectual work of art. Oh my word what an excruciatingly insane movie. There are just not enough words to completely and fully describe this confusingly slow and bewildering movie. The best part about this movie is the title. It's the only thing that fits it. &#34;RUST&#34;. Couldn't have titled it any better myself. Watch at your own intellectual risk. And happy rusting. 😬

"Nice compliment to the complete series, but could be viewed by someone who hasn't seen the series. Great script, plot, and acting. It could have been 6 hours and I'd ask for more, only because I loved the series and hate that it ended. But that's why we have an imagination, I'm picturing the cast still going through the motions with well injected tasteful humor here and there. I also imagine Anna and Mr. Bates having a spin off of their own, I just love them as a couple. Hmm, I think I'm going to pop the disc in and watch it yet again. 👍👍"

I enjoyed this movie!  It was lovely how they pulled Carson back into the household once again😊  All the staff cleverly side tracked the King’s regular staff so they could have their chance to serve the RHs during their short stay @ Downton.<br />There have been several reviews about the story line being all about the Butler’s being gay on Amazon.  Some people went on quite a tangent about it in reviews having taken over the movie.  UTTER NONSENSE.  I saw one brief kissing  scene & that was it!  As a matter of fact it was one kiss so hardly anything to get excited over!  No real racy scenes.  Honestly.... if you are that homophobic then don’t watch.  The story line had so many things going on!  The actors were wonderful as expected & the filming was beautiful!  A must see for Downton Abbey fans❤️

"Meh...Nothing new with this film, but, I paid (Redbox) so I watched!  I found it to be the type of movie you can watch while multi tasking and still not miss a beat.  To me there was not enough build up to justify the eventual, extreme lengths of the neighbor.  I am a fan of JLo movies which is why I gave this one a shot.  The acting and cast were good, but the film just left me underwhelmed overall. 😟"

Better than I expected it to be however they could have followed the script that Barbara Curry wrote as it had more details in it but for a 24 day filming and a low budget it was worth watching 🙌

This is pretty much a spot on impression of old Martin Lawrence acts.<br /><br />The material is pretty dated as well—Steve Irwin jokes don’t hit like they used to. 🤷‍♂️

"This film 📽️🎥 inspired Quentin Tarantino. And I can see why. It's def that good.👍 I mean let's face it alot of those old kungfu movies are a joke. But like a not funny one. This is not one of those movies, everything just work brilliantly here. This movie also inspired the classic video game Street Fighter 2. As well as yours truly. 🙈 See it and get inspired. Oh also there are other versions of this available, but you shouldn't attempt to watch them as they are hot trash. Not so here. This is the one true definitive version of the film. At least out of the ones I've seen. I've seen this movie like eight times, although only three different versions. This one is the best. Note: this reviews the 2 disc anniversary deluxe edition. If you can find for $10-$15 then it's a good deal. Unfortunately there are quite a few unscrupulous merchants on here and they're always trying to jack up the price."

What a extremely good movie & the twist at the end! You will fall in love with the main character Kya - I connected to her on so many levels! Also love the black couple that own the shop in town that was always so kind to her! You have to follow the movie closely to figure out what happened & who did it!🔎

"My husband and I were really excited to introduce this to our children. We have fond memories of seeing this as children ourselves.l, but we haven't seen it in decades ourselves.<br />Cartoons made back when Fantasia came out were rarely actually for children, we know now as adults. But movie ratings didn't come out until the late 60s. Who in the WORLD decided to rate Fantasia as G?<br />There is nudity in this movie. Something my husband and I were unaware of. Genderless nude cherubs. Topless women centaurs. And towards the end, 3 very up-close, almost full-screen, anatomically correct shots of topless women.<br />The music is fantastic, of course, but man .... Completely unnecessary for that nudity in there. 😒"

I love Robot Chicken and Star Wars 😊👍. Mix these two together and you have awesomeness. This was the third installment of the Star Wars themed episodes and or short movies and it's nothing short of greatness. If your a fan of cartoons and adult humor then you will love this film.
"It won’t play on my cheap-o Walmart blu-Ray player but it works on my PlayStation 3.<br />Cool movie directed by Clown of Slipknot with cameos from other members Slipknot. The theme song is hella catchy, 🎼Officer Downe, D-D-D-D-D-D-Downe🎼<br />They need to make a special edition with commentary, there’s only 2 extra features on this, a behind the scenes feature and an interview with Kim Coates."

"Having watched 7 seasons of Buffy and 5 of Angel, I figured it was about time to watch the movie version of the watershed television show. Since the Blu-ray double feature was about the same price as Buffy alone, getting the double was a no-brainer.<br /><br />Buffy 💀💀💀<br />I figured: How bad could it be if Joss was the director? As it turns out: It's an anemic version of the TV show, but then Joss only had 86 minutes to make his case here. The humor, of course, is what keeps this production from being a disaster. Rutger Hauer as the Big Bad was a pleasant surprise; if you've ever wanted to see him wearing lipstick, this is your chance. Kristy Swanson did well enough as the first incarnation of Buffy, but you will surely yearn for Sarah Michelle Gellar as you view this if you're a fan of the TV show.<br /><br />Jennifer's Body 💀💀💀💀<br />I had heard the name Megan Fox prior to viewing this, but this was the first time I recall seeing her in motion. Not bad. I think this production was probably a bait and switch to some degree, marketed to sexually frustrated teenage boys with the promise that it would be very much about Jennifer's (Megan Fox's) body. Instead, Fox plays a perfect tease, and at its heart the film is about a life-long friendship between two decidedly different girls. I checked out (afterwards) some negative reviews of Jennifer's Body, and they were predictable: not enough gore, no nudity. Okay I'll admit I wouldn't have complained if the succubus that Fox turns into had run around in the buff (as a succubus is wont to do), but that may have detracted from what Jennifer's Body actually has to offer. And for a non-horror moviegoer such as me, there was more than enough gore.<br /><br />Jennifer's Body overflows with both tropes and rejections of tropes; the humor is smart and sometimes satirical, so keep sharp not to miss the subtext. It's not just in what the characters say, it's also in their actions and even their appearances. Jennifer: ""They have this really awesome 9/11 tribute shooter, it's red white and blue but you have to drink it really fast or it turns brownish."" Even this one line is open to interpretation (e.g., the fringe right-wing fear of people with brown faces ""taking over"" the USA).<br />I look forward to watching it again someday to see what I missed the first time around, and I may just go to see Megan Fox's lead role in the upcoming Zeroville (I need another movie before I decide if she is a proficient actress).<br /><br />⚖ Final Verdict ⚖ Buffy was as mediocre as I suspected it would be. Jennifer's Body was the surprise: a  black comedy horror flick that can be embraced by feminists and cerebral people of all stripes."

Another childhood favorite of my little brothers and myself. And the 3ninjas movie’s.🤣🤣🤣🤣 I vividly remember us running around the house like little mad crazed wannabe ninja 🥷 kid’s. So we ended up getting karate classes 🤣 and my younger brother was a natural. I was more interested in jujitsu and our middle brother didn’t care much for the classes but baseball.

"This is a great movie. Like really but over half the movie is speaking in another language, and I spent a lot of time looking down at the subtitles, which took me away from the movie just a little. That's why I give it 3 stars but if you don't mind a lot of subtitles. This is easily a 4 or 5 🌟 movie."

"I have to admit I had decided to not research this film at all before purchasing the blu ray. I based my purchase on the cast and the great word of mouth I was hearing. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the plot line...and admit that I did NOT see that ending coming! What a wonderful treat to have gone into it blind, without any spoilers! Great casting & wonderful performances! Bravo to Quentin Tarantino, and of course, Leo DiCaprio & Brad Pitt (the best male pairing since Paul Newman & Robert Redford). This film is a most inventive and satisfying homage to once upon a time in Hollywood. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"

What’s not to like. Really a fun movie. Top performances with a well written script and superb production values. That’s what it’s all about. Give us more Mr. Tarantino. You’re just getting started🤓👍🏽🥁

"If you like Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio plus some pretty girls you will love this movie ! Surprise ending !! I had know idea when I bought it that it was tied in with the Manson murders in the late 60’s, once again, Powerful Ending!!! 🤦‍♂️"

"Fabulous movie 🍿  🎥.  Quentin Tarratino outdid himself on this. Wonderful ending, that’s the way it should have happened back on 8/9/1969."

I'm extremely biased to anything that has Leo in it but I love this movie. Not one of my favorite leo films but i think its definately worth a few rewatches and i shared this one a few days ago with a friend.  Rating not at 5 stars because it's not wolf of wall street 😂

"I have loved this movie since I was a kid. As an adult I appreciate it for so many more reasons than I did when I was younger. It's very well done movie and the cinematography is very interesting. I love that it's in black and white.  I was disappointed by the lack of crisp clean video (I think I was hoping for a video quality like Dead Man or Ansel Adams 😏), but my husband who is into cinematography said it's really very good for a film from the 60s."

"This movie is pure art all the way through and one of my favorites of all time. This period piece is perfect from the acting, set design, costumes, makeup, scene locations, the dialogue and stories told of the south Korean artist Jang Seung-Eop are those of legend and should be required viewing for anyone who loves art and film, action, drama, profound ideas and unique perspectives about life. This man was a true artist in every sense of the word. More than this, he was a revolutionary artist. He refused to be anything except true to himself and his art. Always.<br /><br />It’s a shame this film 🎞 isn’t in circulation anymore. But the fact that it’s more rare and difficult to find makes it even that much more special. I will always cherish this movie and I’m so glad I have it again to show my friends, family and fellow art lovers. I hadn’t seen it since I first rented it at Blockbuster in the foreign film section decades ago. This will tear your heart, mind and soul out and put it back better than before.  Do yourself a favor and buy it, prepare to be transformed then watch it! You will be glad you did. I’d give it 1000 stars if I could. Chi-hwa-seon (Painted Fire) forever!"

"I shouldn't love this movie so much but I do. I tried to hide it. I tried to deny it. Some movies just stick with ya and for some reason certain movies call ya into repeated viewings, like this mini masterpiece. Why?<br /><br />First, the tone. The movie manages to maintain a consistently dark tone on all fronts: script, dialogue, cinematography, mood, character performances. That moody cinematography tho. Even during the car chase scenes which, by the way, rival some of the classic best in riveting tension.<br /><br />Second, Werner Herzog. That's right. This movie's bad guy boss is Werner freakin' Herzog. The rest of the roster ain't bad either. All of the players here deliver tonally rich and complex performances: Rosamund Pike and Richard Jenkins as father-daugher team are a delight, David Oyelowo's complicatedly cool corrupt cop is so magnetically charismatic, Jai Courtney is genuinely creepy and scary, and Alexia Fast's characterization of Sandy manages to be memorably tragic. By the time Robert Duvall shows up, the movie is already hitting on all cylinders. The chemistry between Cruise and Duvall in the third act is a high octane boost for the finish line win 🏁 (yes, I suppose that is a nod to 'Days of Thunder' just like Cruise and Duvall's team-up reprise here).<br /><br />Lastly, Tom Cruise's portrayal of Jack Reacher surprisingly works. No over-the-top intense characterization theatrics or stereotypically over-the-top stunts. Cruise creates a refreshingly low-key real-world character and even manages to sprinkle in a few insightful philosophical observations about the concept of freedom.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to the sequel but quickly realized that the unique blend of elements this first movie possesses did not carry through to the sequel, sadly.<br />This first movie's rock solid cast, script, mood, ambiance, and tone made for a surprisingly memorable movie experience. Perhaps in no small part due to the Christopher McQuarrie directorial quality-control stamp of approval. The Cruise-McQuarrie teaming here definitely delivered much in the same way they have managed to revitalize and improve on the Mission Impossible franchise with each successive iteration."

I thought this movie very well written and put together. I was really amazed how it kept me and my husband on the edge of what was going to happen next. At the beginning the writer left it to the imagination that the mother and father was upset with the daughter because she married her cousin and had a family with him that was not pleasing  to her parents. This movie was extraordinary!👍🏽👍🏽

"This is truly one of the best animated features ever made outside of the classic Disney films. However, the print source from which the bluray I purchased was inferior to even the DVD copy. Huh?🤔 Visible scratches throughout proved extremely distracting from what is a brilliantly told, charmingly performed and excellently animated family movie.  Very disappointing. This film and it's long time fans deserve a better reproduction. I would buy it again if the powers that be would put in the effort."

Robin.when<br />he appeared.. and, told Batman. ""YOU MUST FIND US "".. which is very interesting.. and could lead to another movie with Ben Affleck as Batman and a new guy as Robin ..and that will be excellent. if it is me as good as this movies....👍👍👍👍👍"

"Added a star because I failed to realize I wrote my initial review on the “Ultimate Edition” which is the extended cut. Now I finally got around to watching the “Ultimate Edition” and it is, as everyone seems to be saying, a much better movie. Makes one wonder what they were thinking cutting it back so much in the first place! I still have some issue with not being able to understand Lex Luthor’s motivation entirely, and the way Luthor is played. He really is more of a Joker than a Luthor in this movie, seriously. The extended version is much slower paced, but it really needs to be for the development of the plot and characters. Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman is still the best part of the movie, by far, in my opinion. 😉 Go check out this version of the movie if you have not yet done so. Go do it!<br /><br />As a fan of the franchise I felt I had to see the movie. Affleck did alright as Batman, better than expected. Jesse Eisenberg is a good actor whom I am a fan of, however I strongly feel he was miscasted as Lex Luthor. Kevin Spacey was a good Luthor in Superman Returns, and perhaps would have seemed perfect for the part, if not for Gene Hackman already having played Luthor in the original Superman movies (Let's face it, Hackman IS Lex Luthor). I feel DC/Warner Bros just entirely gave up on finding a fitting actor for the part. In Dawn of Justice, Luthor seemed more along the lines of The Joker. His motivation for his actions were never clear. The storyline itself was all over the place. I think too much was fit into one movie. It would have been better if more was put into character relationships/development, and then continue the plot in part 2. The issue is opposite of The Hobbit movies, where a single 300 page book turned into 3 lengthy movies. I don't have much interest in seeing this movie a second time, however if you are a fan of the franchise, as I, you should see it at least once. Perhaps a rental will suffice. If you love it, then you can go ahead and add it to your collection. On the positive side, Wonder Woman was great! :D I would have loved to see more of her!"

Jesse Eisenberg is a good actor whom I am a fan of, however I strongly feel he was miscasted as Lex Luthor. Kevin Spacey was a good Luthor in Superman Returns, and perhaps would have seemed perfect for the part, if not for Gene Hackman already having played Luthor in the original Superman movies (Let's face it, Hackman IS Lex Luthor). I feel DC/Warner Bros just entirely gave up on finding a fitting actor for the part. In Dawn of Justice, Luthor seemed more along the lines of The Joker. His motivation for his actions were never clear. The storyline itself was all over the place. I think too much was fit into one movie. It would have been better if more was put into character relationships/development, and then continue the plot in part 2. The issue is opposite of The Hobbit movies, where a single 300 page book turned into 3 lengthy movies. I don't have much interest in seeing this movie a second time, however if you are a fan of the franchise, as I, you should see it at least once. Perhaps a rental will suffice. If you love it, then you can go ahead and add it to your collection. On the positive side, Wonder Woman was great! :D I would have loved to see more of her!"
This movie was great. I cried for days when Superman was killed😢😢😢 Rest in peace Superman 💪

"SPOILERS. don't read on if you don't want to be spoiled.<br /><br />here's my opinion on BvS.<br /><br />First off if there was any concern for the movie being jam packed, consider it not an issue at all. Wonder Woman's role fit well with the story and did not divert from the plot, more on her later. Also the cameos were handled really well and were more like Easter eggs. 👌🏽<br /><br />Action was amazing! Best part for sure. The actual showdown between Bats and Supes was too short but boy was it epic. The fight scenes in general could have been longer but I'm overall satisfied with that portion.<br /><br />Another highlight was the music. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL outdid themselves on this one, with the theme for each character being a perfect fit. I especially loved that every time one of the big 3 came onto the scene, the music transitioned smoothly to the newer character. Wonder Woman's intro music was so phenomenal it gave me chills. It had such a Greek/roman/300 warrior vibe to it that it made one feel a part of the battle. Batman's theme instilled the same feeling of grit and darkness that one would feel when looking upon Batfleck. It was so apparent that even when he wasn't in the shot, you still felt the dark knight's presence. Superman's theme made me feel safe, weightless, & entitled to a higher calling especially when it transitioned from Batman's theme. Literally went from feeling aggressive to at peace in a smooth fleeting moment. Again kudos to Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL.<br /><br />Now the acting was also great, especially Ben Affleck; might be some of the best acting he's done in his entire career. There's also high potential for him being THE BEST Batman EVER and that being said his Bruce Wayne was even better and definitely the best I've seen on screen. Batfleck's intimidation and fighting skills were on par with his comic book counterpart as was his charisma, charm, and wit when it came to Bruce Wayne. Best character of the movie by far.<br /><br />Wonder Woman was super badass and also one of the top parts to take away from this movie. Her fighting scenes were a refreshing change of pace compared to Supes and Bats and we actually got to see the lasso so that was cool. I only wish she was in the movie more, but I got to say I'm even more excited now for a Wonder Woman movie after seeing this flick. Great performance by Gal Gadot.<br /><br />Now I had no issue with the plot itself but the direction it followed was probably the downside to this film. It was really hard to connect with the struggle between Superman and the humans that questioned his motives, especially since it was supposed to drive the story. I feel the transitions and the little time they spent on that struggle contributed to the lack of a connection. The courthouse scene definitely struck more of a chord, but definitely needed more focus on that part of the plot. Superman's internal struggle also was brief, but I felt that was warranted since Man of Steel tackled that already.<br /><br />Now going back to the transitions.. they were definitely jumpy, especially in the beginning & I feel it threw most of the plot into a random mess of things. Again the acting did tie those scenes down, but the way this was cut and edited could have been better; I feel that factor drew the line between it being either the G.O.A.T. or pretty good and unfortunately it was the latter.<br /><br />Overall, this was more of character driven movie as opposed to plot driven. Was it the best comic book movie ever? Nah there's definitely room for improvement, but it's not as bad as the critics say. I do like it more than Man of Steel and I enjoyed that movie also. BvS was definitely a lot of set up and more of an introduction but I think this is a decent step into a larger DC universe & I'm glad Warner Bros. is committed to it. The future is bright and I can't wait to see more films from this saga.<br /><br />Oh last thing, I want more Alfred! good comic relief and Jesse Eisenberg was entertaining but we need just a bit more sinister Lex.<br /><br />My Overall Score: 7/10"

"I search high & low for this movie only (not the sequels) and no apps have this one. Forget about Netflix it has no hollywood movies not Hulu, not tubi (yes not tubi), not hbo max, Amazon prime even at least😭, not even the unpopular movie steaming apps have it. Poison ivy is a great movie one of the best Drew Barrymore movies made. I don’t know what people are writing in with their summary of the movie. It is not trash. Could it be b/c Drew’s character is having sex with her friend’s father and she’s underage?? But they are worse n trashier shocking movies than this shown on these apps but not this movie? I don’t get it."

"Rewrite: the subtitles are fixed! Bravo Amazon! I’m thru 10-mins of it and it looks like it’s spot on with the dialogue. 5🌟<br /><br />5-stars for the movie—great movie, indeed. 1-star because of Prime’s subtitles; it’s dodgy at best. Shame, because it’s a brilliant movie. Hopefully Prime can fix it since it’s terribly difficult to get it via Apple iTunes (you actually need an account based on another region, for example, Australia)."

"This 3 disc set collects all 3 seasons of Æon Flux that aired, first, on MTV’s Liquid Television and then, ultimately as its own standalone series. The transfer looks and sounds great and it’s nice to have the original series all in one place. Unfortunately, as another reviewer stated, NOTHING on this set is in chronological order. Seasons 1 & 2 are on the 3rd bonus disc with the extras. SMH 🤦🏻. And even those are not in the correct order. While it might not matter to most, ordering them chronologically as they were originally broadcast makes the most sense if you want to watch the development of the series. Zero logic behind the decision to order the episodes that way. My guess is some stooge at Paramount who wasn’t even born when Æeon Flux aired gave this the OK. You can easily find the correct order online with a quick search. Just don’t get too comfortable unless you have a multi disc changer."

"Wow what a way to ruin a franchise, but I guess that's what some people wanted to happen.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Terminator movies since I was a kid in the 80s, and this movie just craps on the original T1 and T2<br /><br />Seriously what was the point of this movie? They could have easily done some kind of spinoff series, instead of taking a perfectly good story and changing it because they wanted a female savior.<br /><br />I'm all for a strong female lead, but this wasn't it. Utterly disappointed and such a letdown. Hollywood needs to come up with some actual new material, instead of taking something that was a good story and tweaking it to push your political agenda. This makes me not want to ever go to the movies anymore if this is the best they can do. Seriously Hollywood, do better.<br /><br />Also the retired Terminator is a baby changer? Are you kidding me? 🤦‍♀️"

"This movie says little about the actual events of 9/11, why it happened, and unknown players behind the scenes and conspiracies/cover ups. It focuses on families who lost loved ones in Iraq and innocent Iraqi's maimed/killed in the Iraq war and ties the mutually profitable $$$ relationship between the Bush-bin Laden families.<br /><br />Michael Moore is a brilliant director but his views are so extraordinarily far left that he can't even see the middle, thus his views lose balance. Being in the middle allows a person to see both sides, and not be controlled by runaway unbridled extreme political bias.<br /><br />It was an established scientific fact in the dark ages THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT. IT IS. Michael Moore has fallen off the left side of the 🌎 earth here falsely represented as round, and is in liberal freefall."

"Man oh man, the first 10 minutes alone are so filled with politically incorrect humour that would be deemed “racist” and “cultural misappropriation” in this Cancel Culture day & age…and I freakin’ love it!!<br /><br />The puns -- of the zoological and 70s pop culture variety alike -- are priceless! For example, an athletic NYC sewer alligator modelled after John Travolta’s Tony Manero character in “Saturday Night Fever.” 🐊🕺🪩And the Keith Jackson paraodying character alone is worth the price of admission."

"We had seen the previews and it sounded like a good movie.  So we purchased it thinking it would be similar to the previews.<br />BUT, NO IT WASN'T!  We watched it about five minutes and said ""Enough is enough""!  The language was disgusting!  We don't allow language like that used in our home.<br />Yes, we know the previews are acceptable for all ages and we should have read the fine print closer.  But, why ruin what would have been a good movie with vulgar language?  We just put it in our flea market booth and it sold immediately (but we only got a dollar for it)! 🤷‍♀️"

We don't allow language like that used in our home.<br />Yes, we know the previews are acceptable for all ages and we should have read the fine print closer.  But, why ruin what would have been a good movie with vulgar language?  We just put it in our flea market booth and it sold immediately (but we only got a dollar for it)! 🤷‍♀️"
"Great damn movie.  Love it,  as always love the Amazon buying process 😀"

One of my favorite coming of age comedy movies.😊

"This is one of my favorite modern vampire stories.  I always liked Roddy McDowell as an actor and it had different needed elements that make horror films entertaining.  The romance between two lovesick young teens with the villain vampire interested in this innocent girl because she looks like his lost love object from centuries ago.  The comedic hilarity of Roddy McDowell’s cowardice when confronted with the vampire and he is more than alarmed at having to battle him alone.😊  Very entertaining, I give it a thumbs up."

"Watched again in 2022 (the future!). 60 years after it takes place and 50 years after it was made, 😳 the movie speaks to matters that never change: teenage love, leaving home, social pecking order, cars and Rock and Roll!<br /><br />There are some stand out performances and of course this movie put several actors on the map, a few of whom became icons, not to mention the filmmakers themselves. And Wolfman Jack!<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are great with interviews from everyone involved."

"(Fair warning, the trailer doesn't give away any spoilers but PLEASE watch this movie not knowing anything as it gets shocking. It leaves some life details out so it would also be great to do some research afterwards.)<br /><br />Based on the life of reporter Christine Chubbuck, this movie has actress Rebecca Hall portraying her in the year 1974. I knew of Christine's story since the early 2000's as I've heard it time and time again however, I never knew that there was a movie based on her story that released in 2016. Going into the movie, I already knew how things ended for poor Christine but I was quite surprised to see how dark it was. The detail on the makeup and effects were really good almost making me want to cry. Of course on the opposite side of things, I've seen many people criticizing this film saying it's ""tedious"" and ""poorly acted"" so it's all subjective. I personally didn't think it was  bad at all, Rebecca did absolute justice to the stubborn, awkwardly charming, and lovable woman that Christine seemed to be in real life. There were some scenes with such intense feeling and emotion that I think Rebecca conveyed brilliantly, again almost making me want to cry.<br /><br />I have to also give credit to all the other actors as I think they did great jobs and never came off as annoying or irrelevant, I think I liked Jean the most but again I saw people criticizing the way that Christine acts towards Jean towards the middle to the end. I understand why she was upset with her but many said that it made them hate Christine as a person. That's valid but keep in mind that Jean Reed and most if not all characters in this film are based off real people so I can truly believe that Christine really acted this was towards Jean. There were quite a few things cut from real life such as one incident where Christine got angry that someone placed flowers on her interviewing table (I assume it was Andrea Kirby who was dating her crush George Peter Ryan) she must've had a feeling it was Andrea as she threw the flowers at the wall and screamed for no one to place anything on her table. This is just one scenario that I'm sure would've made more people dislike Christine but I personally would've liked to have seen it as it shows how devastated she was to see George fall head over heels with Andrea. Another thing not included was that Christine planned to bake a cake and confess her love for George on his birthday but while talking he brought up how Andrea was taking him to dinner on that night. I already related to Christine in so many ways but these things had they been included in the film would've made me feel even more so. Still, I recommend doing more research if you're really invested in Christine's story but for the most part it includes all of the vital information and imo tells it extremely well. As of now I believe there's only 2 copies of her last broadcast that are kept hidden for good reason. I don't see them appearing for a long while but even if they do it's very controversial. She wanted to show her last brodcast on TV to show that people at the time were getting desensitized to these things and I think she was right. People nowadays are much more desensitized compared to the 70s. In the end I just feel so bad for her, she wasn't perfect but we all are very much like that in some way. I just relate so much to Christine.. the fear of growing old with no one at your side, the feelings of inadequacy, the negative thoughts that you can't achieve your dream job, the pressure to conform to society.. It's all so real.<br /><br />Released 5 years ago in 2016 the blu ray picture quality is pretty great. Some scenes lacked detail and grain was also present at times but they didn't cause any distractions. For most of the film it showed the beautiful detail of the actors and their time accurate outfits especially during closeups. Moving on to audio quality, it's presented only in English but has subtitles for Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finish and English languages. The films soundtrack is recorded in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and its quite impressive. It doesn't wow you as many other films and TV shows do but the audio from start to finish was very crisp and satisfying. This blu ray DVD is also only watchable on region free DVD/Blu ray/4k players in America as its imported from overseas so make sure you have one.<br /><br />Overall a really great film in my opinion. RIP Christine Chubbuck 🙏"

Was upset at first because it had no doubt but did not read that you had to switch from music score to actual movie in the description box. 😆. After that was settled this movie was hilarious just like we remembered. Love the cast! Only thing not good is case is very cheaply made so it is very bendable... If that matters to you. 🤷

"I grew up with Gunsmoke and it’s been a long time coming to finally have the complete series in one complete set at a reasonable price. So far, through 4 seasons, the discs have played flawlessly with no missing discs. Both picture and audio are outstanding.<br /><br />Update 02/28/23: I’m now midway through season 13 and all discs have played flawlessly with no missing discs.<br /><br />This Complete set can’t really be called “the definitive complete collection that no GUNSMOKE enthusiast can do without.” in my opinion though, because it doesn’t include the 5 made-for-television movies that were produced over the following 2 decades after the series ended. They have to be purchased separately…which I did 😁."

Into the Spider-Verse is as Great as they say! While unsettling in moments the Animation was still Top Notch and worth it’s Oscar! You will be Bitten by it🕷!

It wasn't too bad as a movie. Acting was B rated but it could have been worse. I would say there are a lot hotter twink a that could have played Brent Corrigan. 😕

Doesn't really tell a story but does have an interesting take on Japanese punk culture or something. 🤷

"Absolutely one of my favorite campy (tail end of the) 80s movies! I've seen this one so many times, and I'm very excited to see it on Blu ray finally! From the amazing sets, hilarious costumes, crazy cotton candy guns, the typical small town angry cop, the teens who save the day when no one believes them and some great one liners, this is one of the best films in this genre ever made... Totally recommend if you're into these kinds of flicks and haven't seen this one, or if you have and you wanna upgrade your collection to Blu ray like I do👍"

Killer Klowns From Outer Space is a great nostalgia movie and good transfer to blu ray.<br />I'm very satisfied and rate it 5 stars. Just wish the studio would make a Part 2 🎈🤡👍

"Love Liam movies because always a plot, entertaining,  draws you in, exciting,  never dull moments.  Plus his movies are safe for pretweens for family movie nights. Which super helps😃👍  This wasn't his best, but it was darn good and Liam still got his acting skills! Never disappointed in his movies👍👍👍"

She was phenomenal! I mean, Wow.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong tho because the WHOLE ENTIRE CAST were in their bag!<br /><br />I could do a whole reaction video on this movie but I'll end it by saying that I don't know if I can ever watch another so called black love movie the same ever again.<br /><br />To every one that had a hand in this production Please just take these ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ and these 💐💐💐💐💐 and get etched into stone as one of the greatest cinematic love films ever.<br /><br />#Top5. . . easily<br />#Number1. . .quite possibly<br />#Claudine. . . did it better"

"This has remained on my Top 25 list of sci-fi films since first seeing it in the 1980s. If you haven't yet, please do yourself a favor and give it a try. No CGI, but it's films just like this one that remind us how science fiction doesn't necessarily need high-tech wizardry to be top notch.<br /><br />Caveat emptor. If you are considering purchase, check out [[ASIN:B004ZJ9VXY 50 Movie Pack: The Brother from Another Planet, etc.]], which is a much better deal (I just bought it for $9). If you don't care about the extras found on the MGM release (Audio Commentary by John Sayles, Featurette with John Sayles) or the aspect ratio (the MGM release is 16:9, the Movie Pack version is 4:3), then you may as well own 49 additional movies for less money than the cost of this one. 🚀"

Why was the digital copy insert not included with this blu ray collection? The discs are good yes but I should think that such a pricy collection should be 100% complete with the digital copy. Such a disappointment 👎🏻

"Saw this movie twice in theaters, bought the blu ray and dvd that came with the ""disco sucks"" t-shirt. I've been waiting for this movie ever since I was 11 and saw the devils rejects. It did not disappoint. Many bitter people give his movies bad reviews solely for the fact that they aren't into this kind of slasher horror / just wanna see the good guys always win. Or parents just think it is turning kids into torture porn loving sociopathic sadists or something. I love the Firefly family though and this is my favorite movie right now. Great for a family movie night, halloween party, or church bbq.<br /> Also, rest in peace Sid Haig, you are a legend Cutter. 🔪"

"El Cid is one of those films  you enjoy seeing again and again. A lot of little girls  I'm sure fell in love 🥰  with him just as they must have when he stared as Ben-Hur.<br />A very heroic man as ever there was once.<br />I still can't believe that he and his co star, Sophia Loren,  supposedly hated each other's  guts.<br />Well, they had to put their differences aside.<br />When that happened , they hit it out of the ballpark.<br />The Blu-Ray disc had no captions and no bonus features.  If it would have,  I could have known what the characters said and not. second guess.<br />Wonderful  performances, a truly  classic  🎥<br />film.<br />Viva Chuck!"

I will not watch this movie at night!😂"

"This movie was so genius yet hilarious. Michael Jai White did his thing; creating, writing this movie. I'm surprised it doesn't have many reviews. I made random people watch this movie that's how in love in fell with this movie. It's definitely worth the purchase. 😊"

"I watched this movie on Netflix around 2010-2014 and haven't seen it since. It was soon removed and I was devastated. You couldn't find it anywhere! The first time I saw this movie, I was crying for two hours. One hour during the movie and one hour after the movie. I would like to experience this feeling again! This movie is a must see if you want to ball your eyes out. I'm so glad that I found it! ❤  Thinking of watching it with my boyfriend to see if we can cry together. 🤣"

"This movie as you can assume from the name does not know what it wants to be. One part historical fiction, one part wrinkled John wick, one part comedy, and one part safari adventure. As entertaining as that sounds they don’t blend them in this movie. You feel like you’re watching three films at once. When I saw Bigfoot I laughed so hard I almost died. He looks like a short and skinny monkey that’s zombified. They literally fight in hand to hand combat and Bigfoot throws up on his face a bunch. Pour Sam Eliot why did you do this movie? By the way there is no real closure with this film for Sams character in any of the timelines. Big Nope 👎"

I am a true Star Wars geek. I enjoyed the final movie and like the similarities to old movies in subtle ways throughout the film. Loved Luke. Can't stand Palatine. Great movie overall. 👍

"Amazing ending 👍, I had to think about it for a while and while it wasn’t perfect, seeing what JJ had to work around such as Carrie’s passing and the story that Rian Johnson told for The Last Jedi, I think he did a wonderful job portraying the final story of the Skywalker Saga. I understand that people are upset about this that there is a lack of creativity, but personally I enjoyed the nostalgic feel because this is concluding the story. I have no problem with Rey being a Palpatine and going back to the previous films, his return and her story as a Palpatine make so much sense and I do believe this fit her story well even without her parents being around."

My new favorite movie!!😍😘 this trilogy has bumped my Twilight obsession. I can't believe Erica is going to make us wait until 2017 for the second installment. This is some Mean fuckery I tell you!😡 &#34;Say You Love Me&#34; is my new favorite song for all times and Jesse Ware has gained a new fan.

"Sexy, Elegant, Inocente, Erotica sex scenes where tastefully done!!!  Is how I describe this movie. I watched it in the theater on Valentine's Day, and I really LOVED it - I had already read the trilogy, but after watching the movie, I felt compelled to re-read the books again.<br />Now all I can do is wait for the movie to come out in Blu-ray, so I can re-watch this movie 😉. I really hope they end up making the movie sequels &#34; Darker &#34; & &#34;Freed&#34;.<br />So what I don't understand is:<br />If you don't like Erotica romance novels, why read the books then? To complain I guess.<br /> If you didn't like the books, don't like BDSM Erotica stories, why go watch the movie? Don't get that one at all *rolling my eyes*<br />Not an *Abusive* movie as ignorant people are stating.<br />The complete love story of Anastasia Steele & Christian Grey these two loving one damaged - one inocent carectors are told in three books trilogy.<br />The FSOG movie was about 2 hours long, they had to cut many of the special sexy scenes that everyone (fans of the books) loved so much. It would be impossible to incorporate the complete storyline in this first installment - it was a movie,with time limitations, not a mini/full series.<br />&#34; I was very happy with the final product  they made&#34; ☺"

These books were freaking AMAZING!!! So if you want to watch the movies do so before you read the book. The movies are awful if you read it first and then watch the movies. I don’t understand why producers have to “Hollywood” it up. We fell in love with the books. At least we can fall in love with the movie because it’s like the books. I’m so anal about stuff like this! If you’re a producer and want to produce a movie based on books at least do a good job. 🤬

"Loved 1984 more than the first. Great romance story, loved seeing Pedro Pascal out of his armor acting up a storm, a little supernatural twist, Kirsten Wiig got to play a femme fatale more complicated than Sybil, and I especially loved the ""magical realism"" cinematic touch - we haven't seen much of that since 1984.😉<br /><br />Another 1984 bonus, the cameo at the end. Nice compliment to Gal Gadot's solidly helming this solid project. No spoilers!<br /><br />Hollywood needs to make more movies like this!"

"👻 About the Blu-ray:<br />The German release was digitally remastered, and Ghost World now looks much better than a typical DVD from a decade ago. The extras or bonus/special features are limited to a running conglomeration of some random behind-the-scenes footage with Daniel Clowes, Zwigoff, Buscemi, and the two young starlets. It's a haphazardly thrown together pile of scraps, but I found it enjoyable (as should most fans of these individuals or the movie), especially seeing the now big time Scarlett Johansson (aka Black Widow) as a youth goofing around between scenes, e.g., telling Buscemi that they are laughing with him, not at him. Ghost World was Johansson's breakout role, whereas the career of Thora Birch conversely seems to have lost steam after this.<br /><br />👻 About the movie:<br />As of today, over half of the reviews here are 5 stars (57%), with 4-star reviews comprising 19% and 3-stars 10%; the haters are a relatively sparse crowd (7% for both 1- and 2-star reviews). What does this tell us? Well, that maybe this is a cult film, because it certainly isn't broadly viewed (less than 500 reviews after more than a decade).<br /><br />👻 Here's the thing: I liked Ghost World lots more when it came out. Rewatching now (more than a decade later) gives me the distinct impression that like Johansson, I've changed. When I saw it on the silver screen in 2001, I was in the tail end of my ""hanging at Goth night clubs"" phase, so Enid was appealing (probably due to her dyed black hair and colorless skin, her curves, and her taste in music). Watching it today, I see a girl who is struggling to understand the world and her place in it. No, she doesn't volunteer at soup kitchens, but being self-centered and ""cruel"" is not uncommon for teenagers (or humans); as unlikable as many will find her, there is more truth in Ghost World than folks are likely willing to admit. The other characters (Seymour, Roberta Allsworth, Sidewinder Boss, Doug, etc.) make it clear that Clowes & Zwigoff wanted to make a statement beyond Enid and Rebecca, but the movie is as much a critique of Enid as it is of the people she seems to hate. Does one ever fully outgrow the Ghost World? Perhaps not.<br /><br />At its heart the film is misanthropic, and that's primarily what I appreciated about Ghost World in 2001. Now, however, I find myself more appreciating the performing skills of Buscemi, the vision of Clowes, and the oddness of a young Johansson."

The acting is terrible in this D rated movie. I even asked my significant other if this was a comedy? LOL I just couldn't put my mind to this actual movie with characters acting very stupid. It was so funny watching their facial expressions in this movie. I was like 😑 wow these peeps reactions don't match up with this tragic Ice Age... Dad what's happening? I don't know son! Dad smiles back at his confused son. 😆 I got lost in every current and past event. I was sitting on my couch why aren't they screening! This is very tragic big chunks of ice falling down from the sky hmmm  I guess I'll just keep my comments to myself. 🤔

"I saw this first soon after it came out. Not at the theater, mind you, but late one night on showtime back in the day when I was 10 or 11 years old. WHY in the world my parents allowed that is beyond me but suffice it to say...I never did babysit much after that. Yes. It's THAT scary and THAT good. Now in my 40's I still WILL NOT watch it alone. I can watch the Halloween movies, Friday the 13th series, and many other &#34;scary&#34; movies alone - but this takes horror to a whole other level for 2 main reasons:<br /><br />1.) it could actually happen and,<br />2.) it is based on suspense. No blood, no gore, just sheer terrifying suspense.<br /><br />The two above elements IMO, make anything 100x scarier.<br />I won't go on and on (as others have)  - and I won't be a b!**h and tell you the plot and the ending (like others here do), just trust me and promise to watch it WITH someone else, AND don't show it to an impressionable preteen or you will NEVER get her to babysit....not for ANY amount of $ 😄😳<br /><br />A BIT OF A SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS:<br /><br />Edit: I want to add to my review because I've read others here that crucify the middle of the movie (or as some would refer to it as the second act). I tend to look at this part of the movie in a bit different way. Many here in the comments probably and wanted, and expected that after the first act it would keep up or intensify into just another slasher bloodbath. If this is your hope and expectation- you'll be disappointed and puzzled. INSTEAD... how about dropping the expectation, taking a few deep breaths (if you can catch your breath after the beginning) and appreciating the unique quality this over 40 year old suspense-fest gives you. If you missed the point of the beginning or the fact that something was THAT terrifying although you saw nothing (no blood) and heard nothing, then you missed that this movie was probably going to be MAINLY suspense and more of a mind-f^^k, a psychological thriller, but NOT a slasher flick.<br /><br />Ok, so from that perspective let's look at the middle. We are taken on a journey from the psycho's perspective. We see him meet and target someone else in a (yes) slow but DEEPLY disturbing way. There are a few veeerrrryyy creepy things in this second act if you ask me, so I wouldn't by any stretch call it boring. Now granted, I minored in psych in college so this whole ""study"" or second act which gives a glimpse into his doings IS fascinating to me - but maybe that's just me. But, if you also enjoy suspense and actually find all of it way more frightening than a bunch of idiot teenagers getting whacked left and right, then you'll dig this movie too.<br /><br />Having written that, you'll be happy with your heart rate being tested once again and want to hold onto yourself for the finale....just a warning.<br /><br />All in all, and depending what you personally find scary or what you are looking for in a horror film, this shouldn't disappoint. But my earlier advice applies - don't watch it alone or if you have to sleep alone that night. I don't still and I've seen it many times!"

"Clever, funny, sexy, serious. That's just describing Elizabeth Hurley. But starts to describe this movie. Sure it is silly, but with a VERY talented cast and a great story, enhanced by a great script. Brendan Frazier is hilarious in what is actually several roles, as is the rest of the supporting cast. Great addition to my movie collection.This movie has a great story and a happy ending, who doesn't love happy endings?😆 I've always had a thing for Elizabeth Hurley so I'm a little biased on the movie. Brandon Fraser is great and funny in this movie. Movies came very fast and as expected couldn't be happier, thanks Amazon!"

"We saw this movie on prime and want to add it to my collection. I absolutely love horror and this one actually gave me nightmares. The people leaving bad reviews are clueless and don't know a good thing when they see it. I've seen many horror movies from the first exorcist to modern day reboots and ideas. This one is truly special. The acting is very early 90s late 80s. Very well done. 👏 Although the acting may not be what is seen in this knew woke trash age, it is good non the less. Everything you see a tape and is cut to the interpreters, you are left wanting to see another, and another. The more you see the more twisted is becomes. The longer you stare at the abyss the longer it stares back. It honestly reminded me of hereditary in the sense that it felt new. Like something not done in the manner that it was. I highly recommend it and will be purchasing this and adding it to my vast collection of horror films."

"Plot-wise, it's a simple and enjoyable story. Eh, could have done a bit better. Weird to hear Anne Hathaway in an anime film but her voice was suitable. Now Cary Elwes 😍😍😍 he was perfect for the role.<br />Product wise, 0 out of 5. I ordered new. I got used. The case, despite being wrapped in plastic, had a piece of the edge chipped off as seen in photo. There were other signs of wear: surface was compressed, edges were scratched, and the cover art had ripples. I checked the discs themselves. They tried their best to cover it up but there signs it was played before: a bit of smears and ring marks at the center.<br />I knew the sale was too good to be true."

Love this movie but the quality of this blu ray I ordered on here sucked. I was excited to watch it and it arrived wit finger prints and skipped the entire film. Go buy it in stores or stream online. I wouldnt order this one. Great movie though. 👎

"I watch this movie for one reason: Alexander Skarsgard. I was so glad I did. It had it all, Love, Romance and a great plot. A great supporting cast including Jason Clark as the husband, Lewis. This is an excellent movie for the WWII buff. All around a superb movie. Five Fantastic Stars on this one. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

"So how would you like to have previews pushed on your face everytime you start the dvd, loud in your face ridiculous previews of violence and fear?  No resume movie option, had to skip thru them with every break.  So I tossed it in the trash half way thru, ""unbroken"" was unfinished. Such is the fate of Hollywood😕"

The value on the Blu-Ray American version runs from $40-$100! Save that money and get this! Believe me it’s all the same just switch the English and BAM! Was sketchy at first but I’m glad I took the risk! 🔥👍👍

Young introverted but determined filmmaker has issues ⛐ between reality & fantasy while 📹 futuristic material for new film as he slowly falls in love with female star. Intriguing film lays heavy on Jeremys shoulders as he gives the film it's endearing quality with his naive innocence yet professional attitude. The movie could have gone four hours & I probably wouldn't notice it. Extremely watchable.

"People must be giving this film positive reviews out of pitty. Why, if christian films make an &#34;attempt&#34; to be on par with Hollywood films, do we praise them even if they fall horribly...HORRIBLY short. The story made sense but the production value was meh. And the acting....OMG. I mean, the lead supporting actress went on to make critically acclaimed films like &#34;Sharknado.&#34; 😒Enough said..."

"Not made for the USA not this region and won’t pay any DVD players  🤦🏼‍♀️.  Make sure to read the discription, it worked on my computer though, only because my computer allowed me to change the region. I shouldn’t have bought a non prime item anyways. so I blame myself it would have coast me $25 to return, it was a big waste of money."

It was listed as “Good” and I really wanted it to go with my other extended editions so I took a chance and bought it. I couldn’t wait to watch it to see what was wrong with it and to my surprise I didn’t find anything wrong with it. 🙌🏾 I missed out on buying this 5 disc extended version box set years ago and I’m so ecstatic to have found such a well kept box set in its original package for such an excellent price! Thank you 🙏 🙏😁

"EASILY one of my favorite movies of all time.  And one of Tim Burton’s best, for sure, and that is saying something!  The entire cast is extraordinary.  Keaton is an absolute gem but each and every character is rich and played extremely well… from the main characters to the dumb football player to the janitor.  The storyline, the bureaucracy of the afterlife, everything is just so creative and imaginative.<br />Although a different genre altogether, Beetlejuice is right up there with the likes of The Princess Bride as far as CLASSICS go. Not to mention quotable quotes!  Lines from Beetlejuice are regular household inside jokes around our home.😆🤓<br /><br />Definitely a film I can watch over and over and over (…and I have.  We know every word by heart) and the constant, non-stop hilarious dialogue never fails to make me laugh like it’s the first time I’ve ever heard it.<br />If you haven’t seen this movie yet… WHY NOT?!  Buckle up for a wacky, hilarious ride.  😵‍💫🥸"

"Yes, the DVD is called ""Ice Guardians""<br /><br />However, this is the ultimate DVD on the NHL ""Enforcers"".<br /><br />This DVD has so much information and is broken up in to terrific segments.<br /><br />I was totally glued to it and decided to watch it twice.

DISGRACEFUL & UNPROFESSIONAL<br /><br />Hockey players are the best of the best.<br /><br />They put their heart, soul, passion, love, sweat, tears, and ultimately their bodies into whatever it takes in the game of hockey.<br /><br />The ""Enforcers"" go out on the ice night after night after night doing their jobs.<br /><br />The ""Enforcers"" training is extensive; Weight Lifting, Running, Spinning, Boxing, Karate, Jujitsu, etc...<br /><br />No other sport can even come close to the dedication of hard work and ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Thank You to the NHL ""ENFORCERS""<br /><br />I Highly Recommend.<br /><br />You Will Not Be Disappointed - Promise!!!<br /><br />PHENOMENONAL<br />Definitely Deserves 10 Stars 🌟"

"This 4k presentation of Bird With Crystal Plummage is spectacular! It looks and sounds so good. I'd watched my blu ray copy just weeks before ordering the 4k blu ray from Arrow. Leaps and bounds better. Solid colors and a lot more detail to look upon. Arrow also does a great job of giving you a premier experience when purchasing their physical media. Posters, booklets, case, sleeve...all 👍"

It was somewhat funny - the original was American not  this one 😣 - a lot of Spanish speaking - very disappointing - if I had known it wasn't American i wouldn't have bought or even seen it - the acting was good but not being American just completely  ruined it - if I'd wanted a foreign movie I'd of bought a foreign movie - big mistake to film it the way they did - ruined a good plot full of potential humor and turned it into garbage 😣

"My favourite Transformers movie out of the 4. Very intense battle scenes and a darker story plot. Optimus Prime kicks ass!!! 3D is the way to go, it was nicely done! 👍🏻 My kids love all the Transformers movies. I too love all the movies, since I'm an 80's baby and Transformers was my favourite cartoon series of all time. Seeing the Autobots come to life and engaging in battle with the Decepticons is a real thrill and eye candy. It really brings back memories of my childhood days. Nostalgia at it's best!"

"WHAT A MOVIE ! Not the usual Bogart part you'd expect, but nevertheless brilliant. We get to see his comic side not too often shown. All the actors anyway give excellent performances. Works perfectly from beginning to end, never a dull moment. Lots of enterntainment and good feelings. This is one of those movies you'll find yourself playing from time to time, I totally suggest you get it !! 👍👍"

Absolutely love Buck Brannaman and his methods with horses! I believe it's the ONLY way to train horses and the most humane! My 2 horses are worth training in such a humane way. 👍🏻👍🏻
"I rented this first to make sure I liked it and I ended up loving it more than the first movie. It was hilarious and while I was unsure if I liked the added characters at first, I fell right in love when it all fell into place.<br /><br />I’m hoping someone buys it off my Amazon wishlist for my upcoming Bday! 🤣😂"

I love it! This pill gave me a full on rock hard erection and staying power that lasted for hours!

Betty and Coretta is a movie of very poor quality. I can't even watch it because it skips so much it is ridiculous. So sorry I could not have watched it before May 12th so I could have returned this mess.. so upset 😡

"My Mom and I saw Ghostbusters Afterlife On Nov.19th then On Thanksgiving Day! We both loved It!! It's Funny, Scary and Sad and it was nice seeing The Originals back Playing there roles! ( Just Wished The Originals and Annie and Sigourney had bigger roles in the movie!) Anyway still Awesome and what Jason did at the end for Harold was Nice and Sad! How they did that was Awesome for Harold!! R.I.P. Harold Ramis/ Dr. Egon Spengler!! 🙏<br />Also So Much better then The Reboot!!!😎"

"I love the original movies, such a shame Harold Ramis is no longer with us. This movie really does honor his character,  with the technology today it us so hard to tell it's now him in his small parts.  Most of the girls from the third one are  NOT in it, but they storyline is still is in line with the original movies.  Paul Rudd really is good on this movie, I am a fan of his he does have great range. And love the new "" ghosts "" 👻  especially the cute part in the grocery store.  Most times  ' additional movies'  or continued series are never as good as the original but this one is really good and ' almost  '  as funny as  last one was.  4k is the best way to see it.  Enjoy movie I did!!!"

Great story & all around movie however:the 4 k picture quality (sharpness) fluctuated wildly averaging 30-40 MegaBitsPerSecond (not much better than a blu ray) and as low as 9 MBPS ( a DVD avg is 6 !) paid more for Lemonade but got a Lemon 🍋

"Kino Lorber has done it again! Buck is back and looks brilliant in HD. This set is way better than the DVD set released back in 2004 on those horrible double sided discs. First off, you get original theatrical version of Buck Rogers in widescreen and with commentary by film Historians Steve Mitchell & Nathaniel Thompson. The picture quality is sharp, crisp and vibrantly colorful. The Audio is outstanding. Moving on to Season 1 it was a delight to see the original 2 hour network premiere, which is the (1.33:1) version of the theatrical release, with many extra new scenes that help the story flow seamlessly into the series format. Sadly this version of episode 1 is absent from 2004's DVD. The rest of Season 1 is impressive and ambitious, filled with colorful sets, locations and an impressive assortment guest stars. You also are treated to 9 commentary tracks on select episodes by film and t.v. Historian/Buck Rogers companion Author: Patrick Jankiewicz. I found these to be fun, geeky and very entertaining. Season 2....well its Season 2. The premise of the series changes quite a bit. You get Patrick's insightful commentary on episode 1, ""Time of the Hawk"" along with the remaining 10 episode of Season 2. Some of the episodes aren't that bad at all. It just feels like a different show. So if you can cringe your way around the first few episodes, when Twikki sounds like a child until Mel Blanc returns as the voice we all know and love, you'll find this series from Producer Glen A. Larson a fun and nostalgic ride of late 70's early 80's sci-fi television. Also included were 2 cast member interviews with Erin Grey (Wilma) and Thom Christopher (Hawk). So, was it worth buying the upgrade? Most Definitely!👍👍👍👍👍"

"I absolutely loved this movie. I started watching it and wasn't sure in the first few minutes and then I was pulled into the story and watched it over and over and over. The characters that the actors portray are so real and amazing.  This is a critically acclaimed independent film which I feel deserves an Oscar more than most films out there. The actors are so diverse in their talents that it makes the film even more stunning than the backdrop of the film.  I cannot wait to see more from this director and these actors.  Loved  The diverse levels explored in this movie, the emotions, the empathy, And the reality explored  in the varied circumstances portrayed in this movie.  ❤️💐"

"Probably not a winner for folks who have to see blood, guts and explosions in order to be enter-tained, but for the rest of us it was a very moving story about everything that's good about humans, as well as the traits that don't bode particularly well for our long term survival. It was beautiful and sensitively done, but if your attention span has been trained out of you by play station, cell phones, and all of the other perks of progress, well, it'll probably go right over your head. Believe me, the loss is yours. Meanwhile, the rest of us appreciated this quieter, and more thoughtful form of story telling and story building. And KUDOS to Amy Adams for acting the part skillfully, instead of showing off at the expense of her craft.<br /><br />We are very fortunate indeed that for a very few dollars, we actually get to OWN some of our favorite films. Now THAT's a perk to celebrate! 😉<br /><br />The dvd arrived at warp speed, it was safely n carefully packed, n the movie was still in shrink wrap, just as promised. A very CLASSY Seller. Thank you!"

I love the first 2 movies but this one had me yawning and hoping it would end... I know Transformers aren't known for there human story line but this was just terrible. Between the  ridiculous one liners and far fetched plot it left me sad that I devoted my night to it 😔.  At least the action at the end was cool.

"LOVE this movie. A mind bender for sure. I saw this in the theater 3X and can still watch it and break it down mentally. Having been interested in and reading on Alchemical psychology, helped to frame this story line in a way that I was able to comprehend through that lens.<br />I was already very familiar with the Sator square, which was a great foundation for the many connections in this movie. If you like movies that stick with you and have your brain working on it, this is perfect 😍"

Love 💞 all the Harry Potter movies!!!  Bought this one to replace the one we had that wouldn't play any more. Works great 👍

Jeff Bridges wasn't his best here😞. I love Jeff Bridges and this movie wasn't his best!
Looks Great. Brand new. No complaints. Got her in a timely fashion. Thank you. As a matter of fact it was right on time. 😇😇😱
"Just received Rocketman, was delivered to a neighbor.  Neighbor said it was a 5 star 👍<br />I ordered a Rocketman movie, delivered was a printer cartridge that was for a neighbor.  Hopefully I will receive the movie I ordered soon, then can write a review for the movie."

Movie is a great example of a screwball comedy with an excellent cast headed by James Cagney and the bluray makes the enjoyment all the better!!👍👍

"Great movie, great cast, great director. A movie I've loved since I was a kid. John Wayne as Rock Torrey was believable as a second generation Navy man. And Patricia Neal as Maggie, brought out his humanity. Kirk Douglas's Paul Eddington was a tortured soul until a new war seemed to straighten him out. Ahh, no spoilers. There is a line that Burgess Meredith's character Egan Powell says that I have taken for my own. ""My bones are clicking like a pair of dice on a Reno crap table."" Great writing, it's a gem among war movies. And it goes good with popcorn 😉."

"I bought this movie because I have ""Cleopatra Jones"" on blu-ray and have watched it many times growing up...and older. I never saw this sequel, ""The Casino of Gold"". As a kid I remembered her while watching Jason of Star Command. I saw Cleopatra Jones along with ""Terminal Island"" and ""Coffee"" back in 1973 or 74 with my Dad and Uncle at our local ""drive in"", remember them?, on a boys night out excursion when my Uncle Ricky came to visit us in Massachusetts from North Carolina. What a beautiful woman Tamara Dobson is. Great spy, action packed movie here with Casino! Just bought it because I really like the original...and I was not disappointed at all. I really enjoyed, and will many times more, this excellent film. Made on demand through Warner Archive, its image and sound are Quite Excellent! No bonus material or subtitles, but a great addition to my library. Dated and probably not politically correct to some folk today, it remains as a window to when a film was a film. Fun and escapism from the garbage and correctness they force on the public today. Excellent cast, very exciting and extremely enjoyable!<br />👍👍👍👍👍<br />✌♥️🙂"

"When this movie hit the theaters earlier this year there was a lukewarm response from the critics.<br />Why?  I have no friggin idea.  I thought this movie was awesome.  Yes, Guy Ritchie has a &#34;frenetic&#34;<br />style in the way he tells a story, and it can be off putting to some but in King Arthur: Legend of sword it does work.  Hoping for a sequel!🤞🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾"

Each one has brought me to tears in a feel-good way and my family and I have watched them multiple times. These are well worth getting, I highly recommend them! 😀"

"If I decide to buy a movie, I really have to like it. It’s very interesting story and how his father dealt with his son’s mental health/illness at that time. I’m not a big Ben Affleck fan at all, so it was hard for me to even pick out this movie the first time I saw it! Glad I got past my feelings of BA. I somehow relate to his character with the same type of MH, I’ve watched this many times over… it’s a great movie 🍿🎬😊"

"What did I just watch? The Joshua carpenter character is supposed to be Jesus? So they had His second coming be as His first appearance in doing miracles and having a priest character play the Pharisee of sorts. Though I wouldn’t disagree with the “Pharisaical” fact of priests in general, it’s misguided in this movie. This Joshua character is supposed to be Jesus, yet he says “suck” while being in a bar playing pool with a priest? Huh? Yes Jesus hung around sinners, but He didn’t act like them! The female lead character has a crush on Jesus/Joshua and tries to make out with Him! Sadly I’m not joking! It seems to glorify the Catholic Church, which well don’t get me started. They throw in country and other secular music to boot! Have mercy on the people who created and worked on this mess🙏🏻What in the world?!? Christian film-NO. Another film that distorts and depicts the Lord as well as His word with blasphemous imagery and words!"

This is a great movie about how Charles Dickens wrote A Christmas 🎄 Carol and one thing that was was interesting to me was that they made Charles Dickens the Ebenezer Scrooge character who appeared in the movie as well as as some of the other people who were in the story. That was interesting to me and made the movie all the more interesting even if it was partially fictitious. As I said this is a great movie and you should get it.

"What can I say? Although I'm a big fan of romantic movies, this is the best movie yet. It's about all the sadness, the love and stuff...and it made my heart melt every time they say &#34;okay&#34;. My favorite part is when they had a candlelight dinner and texted each other. And I hate when they had a date funeral (made me sad). Two thumbs way up! :-) 💖"

Finally got the time to watch this (moving)...Popped it in dvd player and nothing.  Missed the deadline for return.  Steer clear of this seller...thought it was a little strange that it didn't come in its original box! 😒

"Hereditary is a different kind of movie,<br />But a very good one it is a trip. Another really good movie is PUMPKIN KARVER.!!<br />People only gave it 3 stars but I would give it a least 4 stars.<br />And Trick 'r Treat movie is really good. It's really unique movie.<br />Creepy & fun I recommend them all great during the Halloween season or when your in the mood for some creepy horror movies. BOO.!!🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃💀☠👽👻"

Well packaged. Picture looks great. Disappointed 😞 still in 2.0. I figured it would have at least DTS HD 5.1

"Gremlins meets toy story. A classic movie about a.i. gone wrong when a greedy toy designer puts military chips inside toys to impress his new boss, which insult in the toys becoming sentient and begin attacking a kid, his family, his crush and her family. And the good sentient toys the gorgonites. This movie was a big piece of my childhood, I grew up watching this movie and it's still a fun movie to see over and over again. Archor is basically Gizmo, and Major Chip Hazard is a more intelligent version of stripe. A great movie 🍿 to keeping seeing for years to come, and a lot better then most of these remakes and lame movies they got nowadays. I wish movies were still like this."

"John Candy may not be the best, but Uncle Buck rocks and The Great Outdoors with Dan Akroyd and Candy is fun to watch. I enjoyed every moment of them. Out of the 2 Candy made the part! Would totally recommend. I may be an adult who grew up with this but if you sat a child or teen down they could find this funny/stupid in their generation😁 but who cares I thought awesome"

"Just bought and watched the FEAST 3-pack movie collection! A helluva lot of comedy and over-the-top horror, complete with blood, guts, gore, violence and more! These characters are crazy, and the interaction between them is hilarious! Influenced by Rami’s Evil Dead franchise, and similar in tone toTarantino’s Grind house, these films are a “must see” for horror fans! Bring a barf bag, eat some popcorn and spew if you must, but you will enjoy the insanity! LOL 😸🎨🎸<br />⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Amazing and Fun film with lots of surprises and twists and turns. If you liked the first one then you’ll enjoy the second one 😍
Absolutely delightful! Why am I talking like that?  This is an excellent adaptation...there I go again. It's a good movie! There I said it 😁

"I never write reviews and seeing all the negative ones this lovely film was getting, I had to put my opinion out there.<br /><br />I am a huge Jane Austen fan. I have read the novel which this adaptation is based on multiple times as well as her other novels. And honestly, I felt this was a very loyal adaptation. Yes of course there are some things added in, as every director as a right to do. They need to place their mark! And the humor in this adaptation was delightful; The costuming was impeccable; the music moving; and the setting a treat for the eyes. All in all lovely<br /><br />In many of the other adaptations (though I love them all) portray Emma to be much older than she is and I felt this adaptation was much more appropriate. She’s a spoiled 21 year old for goodness’ sake, and this shows that off Perfectly. I ould see why some would not like this film If they are not wanting to see anything stray from the previous adaptations. But if you like a breath of fresh air, a little drama, and a good chuckle, this is the perfect period piece.<br /><br />Well done Autumn de Wilde 👏🏻"

"After the abysmal film that was The Last Jedi, I went into The Rise of Skywalker pessimistic. But regardless I wanted to see the movie because I am a Star Wars fan and I wanted to give my honest opinion on it. So after renting it on prime video and watching it. To my surprise, I loved the movie. It was entertaining, fast-paced, and action-packed. Most importantly it felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie. It was back to being a space adventure movie about good vs evil. The Last Jedi, while a Star Wars movie, felt more like a miserable nightmare. Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, subverted expectations, didn't answer any questions, and disrespected the saga. JJ Abrams came in and cleaned up the mess after The Last Jedi.<br /><br />We get our heroes back working together in Rey, Poe, Finn, C3P0, BB8, and Chewie. We learn about Rey and why she is strong with the force. We finally also get to see her train with Leia. It was also great to see Rey have an internal struggle with figuring out who she is and where she fits in the galaxy. It made her character seem more human. Kylo Ren continues to be the best part of the sequel trilogy. The scenes with him and Rey are the best parts of the movie. We also get more back story with Poe and Finn. C3P0 and Chewie also really get there moments to shine in the movie. Luke Skywalker is back to being the optimistic mentor who respects his father's lightsaber again. I thought they did a great job of handling with Leia after Carrie Fischer passed away. Seeing Lando again was also a nice touch. And the new characters that get introduced (like Zorri Bliss, Babu Frik, Jannah, and General Pryde) are also really good additions to the story. Emperor Palpatine was pretty cool as well. A lot of his senses felt like something out of a Horror movie. The visual effects were outstanding. Especially in the space battle scenes. The lightsaber fight scenes were intense as well. I thought the movie had a nice and fitting conclusion to the trilogy.<br /><br />The only issues I had with the movie was the Nights of Ren were underutilized. I would have like to see more of who they are and a bit of there origin. There were some other minor issues here and there but it didn't stop me from liking the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I loved Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker. It was nice to have JJ Abrams come in a finish what he started with The Force Awakens. As someone who was personally disappointed with The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker really helped patch things up for me. I commend JJ Abrams for doing so. (You could even watch Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker back to back while plucking out The Last Jedi completely.) I find it ironic critics bashed this movie But loved The Last Jedi 😒. But as you can see in the audience scores above the fans say differently. And I have to side with fans on this one. This movie and The Mandalorian have reinvigorated my faith in Star Wars. I am looking forward to seeing what comes next.<br /><br />Overall score: 9/10"

This is one of her all-time favorite movies but we couldn’t find it on any of the streaming services. So when I found it here on Amazon I immediately bought it for her and she is beyond happy! I just got back from a 10 day visit with her and I can’t even count the number of times we watched it. 🙂

"Just To mush HIP HOP music for any movie ( THATS NOT  a musical )..AND truly make the movie become boring..<br />And,that is truly the case with this<br />One..even though it had good actors.. the writing for this movie could have been a LOT BETTER..<br />AS WELL AS THE STORY..THIS would be more for high school AND College kids..And.. it promotes UNSAFE driving on the streets as if these students didn't have anything or any other ways to wrap their cars around a pole or end up in someone's living room or killing someone in the process..THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE.. and I'm sure that MOST of these other reviews are FROM high school and. college students..because it's full of there music..👎👎👎👎👎.. and the writers really did not think before they put this movie on the screen.. they just needed to hurry up and make their money off of this film.."

"Great movie, action packed. The lead actor (not sure of his name)was wonderful in this role, he plays it well. It's another one of those troubled youth movies but with a twist. The driving sequences in the movie are fantastic and have you on the edge of your seat. Jamis Fox is great as the bad guy you want to hate. This is a different kind of character for Fox to play, but he does it so well. All in all a great edge of your seat movie with a love story added in, and a happy ending. Enjoy all😊👍"

Baby Driver is a masterpiece. Edgar Wright is a genius. This is one of the greatest crime movies ever made. The way that the soundtrack works with the scenes of the movie is genius. I have seen it 4 times and cannot wait to purchase it on Blue Ray and digital. True Romance is one of my favorite movies and this along with Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction are at the top of my all time favorites. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

"Honestly, the worst movie I've ever seen. That's saying a lot because I loved the Princess Bride from 1987. Compared to Baby Driver, Princess Bride is a Accademy Award winning Master Princess Bride is a masterpiece. 👎🏾👎🏾"

"Ok, it started off slowly...real slow, but the last 30 to 40 minutes makes up for it.  Started to guess the culprit and did not see that ending coming....<br /><br />I must say though the ending was too abrupt; you really needed to see the other characters reactions and this whodunnit didn't...🙄😣"

"For any Lucille Ball fan (& who isn't?) &/or Henry Fonda fan, this movie is a wonderful BOGO!! Two huge stars in one movie! And let us not forget the up & comers amidst their Army of children! In my opinion, this movie is WAAAAY above & beyond the newer remakes! So grab your tissues & put on your Depends, b/c you're sure to laugh until you cry & pee! Maybe even both at the same time! Another BOGO!! 😁"

"The dvd packaging does not look like the one that I ordered. It's some sort of bad drawing of Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn. I just hope that it's not a bootleg. This cover art looks nothing like the original promotional art that Universal studios used. I'll find out in a few days when we have family movie night, I just hope that the other movies that I ordered don't turn out to be a disappointment also. 😕. Definitely a bootleg."

Not for regular DVD players 🤦🏼‍♀️<br />They have a sticker on the front that says “this is what you ordered and it doesn’t work with US DVD players.” So we have to figure out sending it back now I guess

I thought this was a nice story for a 10 year old who loves horses😔 The language is atrocious 😡 My bad for only reading the story line & not the rating😤 I don’t think many adults would want to watch a movie about a 16 year old boy who takes a horse so it will not be put down! Do a remake as PG!!

"This movie may look dated by its clothing.<br />But it is very well done and very very prophetic.<br />“Pursue your present course and face obliteration.”<br />These words spoken by Michael Rennie as Klaatu. The “friendly alien,”who takes a trip to earth in his “flying saucer,” should shake everyone up now as it did in 1951.<br />And who, of course, can ever forgot those immortal words said by Patricia Neal, to  Gort, the giant silver robot with the laser eye,  “Klaatu barada nikto!”<br />Now used many times in many movies and TV shows. Sometimes for laughs and sometimes serious.<br />Very worth buying for any Sci-Fi buff.<br />If it isn’t  in your collection of films.<br />(Shame on you). It should be! It’s a classic.

"I have been a fan of horror movies since I was a little kid. Little scares me anymore. And no horror movie has ever made me cry, until now. I found myself bawling my eyes out because of the sweet relationship between mother and daughter in this movie. I just lost my mom 2 years ago and we had a silly but strong bond much like was shown in this film. I love this movie for a lot of reasons. The acting was brilliant, the story was clever and original and the movie left me with a good feeling inside. A heartwarming one. There were many comedic moments in this film and too many creative and original touches to mention here. I cannot say enough good things about it. It instantly became one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. 💜"

"Package arrived on time and in great condition. Obviously you are not going to find this “New”.. I have loved this movie ever since I was a little dude and Lost it when I moved. It is a must have in any rocker’s collection. The soundtrack and guest appearances alone are a reason to see this movie, but it has a truth to the plot that any Musician can relate to! R.I.P Lemmy🤘🏻"
Am I the only one to see the rampant  plot similarities? 🤣
What can you say? This is a movie classic & now it's on Blu-ray. Great addition to any video library. 😎🌴🇺🇸😉👍😎🌴🇺🇸😉👍

"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie but I did! Just a simple story of a guy trapped in the zombie apocalypse! Elevator zombie has a soft spot in my heart! Loved him 😄<br /><br />I'm going to buy this DVD because I love random, small budget movies as well as the big movies!<br /><br />Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾"

The Muppet movies are among my family’s favorites. Go-to choices for all ages! And as we’re spending extra time inside together these days (and evenings) having such “choice” movies are well worth their price! 😉👍

We love these movies yet must say the quality of the pic wasn’t great. I figured they would have been able to fix that. It’s as if they just copied old movies on to a dvd. We will still watch them because their classics we love. Yet a bit disappointed in the quality of the picture. 🥺

The disc was perfect. Definitely worth waiting for. Kirsten Dunst (actress) is so young in this movie. I really enjoyed it again. My whole family did. This is a good family movie for slightly older children.😀

This is the best series I have ever seen. I can watch them over and over and never get tired. The whole cast is great I love everything about all of them especially James. I hope they make more. The world needs more movies like this 💖

"I guess it's just about fulfilling movie contract. Interesting to see bit actors in movies other than the ones they're famous for like Gonzalez Gonzalez not in a Duke film, Mr. Edgar Buchanan even Leslie Nelson. And the man known as Jumbo in this movie was the drunkard in North to Alaska with the Duke. All in all it's a nice movie and you must admit Shirley MacLaine always gives a great job opposite Glenn Ford two 👍"

"There are some great names attached to this film - Sam Raimi, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, William Sadler, Cary Elwes. For that reason alone, ""The Unholy"" is definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />A journalist barely scraping by (Morgan), with a past of fabricating stories, believes he found his comeback article when he visits a small central Massachusetts town. Alice (played by Cricket Brown, who I haven't seen in anything else) believes she's receiving messages through the Virgin Mary, but something sinister is clearly at work.<br /><br />I like that this film doesn't take the usual ""exorcism"" approach to religious horror. Instead we get sort of a religious mystery-thriller. My only critiques are the overuse of CGI and likely studio-influenced jumpscares. Also, Cary Elwes' fake Bostonian accent. 😂 Other than that, definitely worth a looking into."

"Lovely DVD .  My granddaughter, who is 10 years old, and I, enjoyed watching this together.  It held her attention through the entire movie.  I also bought her the book to read.  I explained to her that the book would be more in depth than the movie so she would get double enjoyment  having watched the movie if she read the book. 😀"

Maggie Smith is a treasure as always no matter her role.<br />The kids are perfect and really do create their own magic 🪄<br />I’ve always wanted to follow Colin and his family for a different magical story because he’s such a great character."

So! My wife and I both loved this silly movie when we where kids and growing up young in the disco era. We both loved that scene in the disco. Especially TO THE RIGHT SONG! I love the nightlife by Alicia Bridges!  IT DOES NOT HAVE THIS SONG ON THIS COPY!. DO NOT BUY THIS! So why do all these reviews say oh it’s on there and and mine didn’t have it on either side of the disc? WHY WHY WHY! You ruined movie night and we both don’t like you anymore!🤬

"ONE OF THE Weirdest movies I've seen...<br /><br />The avant garde directorial weirdness of Bob Fosse's &#34;Sweet Charity&#34; film of 1969 flopped big time for me. I am almost regarding this film as Fosse's trip through existentialism, because he seemed to have created only what he can truly understand; but I won't, as others may certainly find fault in my labeling it as such.<br /><br />The only reason I sat through this nonsensical crap posing as the film equal of the award-winning stage musical (of which I did not see), this study in absurdity, is: there was nothing on worth the time to watch. This hodge-podge of a senseless barrage on the senses didn't hit the mark; moreover, it missed so often, that some of the actors would have been wise to have asked not to be included in the closing credits.<br /><br />This dribble of a snotty, snooty film, replete wth experimental shots, kooky dance routines and painfully blah songs, was only kept in check by the pretty and talented, Shirley MacLaine. Otherwise, it was a disastrous study in crap from the mind of the choreographer/director, Fosse, who may have taken his talent as a dancer 💃 too seriously, thinking it was just a waltz on ice, putting this tripe on film. He may be a highly acclaimed dancer/choreographer, and own 8 Emmys, but film direction is an entirely different creature. Sorry, Bob, but that's the truth (R.I.P.)!<br /><br />I'm reminded of a group of (well-to-do?) people, standing around some coveted painting or sculpture, proclaiming its greatness. How many of those uppity snots truly believe the crap they are looking at deserves more than a passing stare? Sometimes one feels the need to enter the loop, wanting to pass themselves off as &#34;in-the-know&#34; and &#34;cultured&#34;. We've all heard someone say, 'I think what the painter was trying to portray is...'; or concerning film: 'The director was using metaphoric portrayal to...&#34;-- oh, please! Most of this time the director is just experimenting! How does one really know what the director of a film like, &#34;Sweet Charity&#34; was thinking! Well, I know what I like, and this &#34;ain't it&#34;!<br /><br />A Picasso painting can be worth millions, but that doesn't mean it's a true work of art. His abstract cubism is revered the world over, but his stuff is open to interpretation, and everyone will see some different. Does that make it true artistic genius? He couldn't sell a boat load of that crap when he was alive, so what makes his stuff so collectible? Easy one: his DEATH! Think about that one... If YOU were to find a copy of an unknown minimalist sketching Picasso created, studied it for quite a while, and made a PERFECT hand-sketching of it, and asked art &#34;connoisseurs&#34; what they thought, they would shoot you down, stating something like, &#34;well, it is reminiscent of a Picasso, but it lacks the...and the...doesn't quite...&#34;-- see what I mean? It only matters that Picasso did it! But it's a PERFECT copy! What's in a name? Now you know... Oh! I forgot: Andy Warhol's Campbell Soup can art??????? Jesus Christ!<br /><br />In my twenties, I attended a city college for a year, and had to do a report on the film, &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34;, a Stanley Kubrick film. We sat through two days of this film before we had to begin our assignment. I was so unaffected by the film that I turned in a lackluster report-- and received an &#34;F&#34;! I could not find inspiration to even summon up a decent thumbs-down review of this film. Yet, many (film-goers) hailed this as a great film! Go figure...<br /><br />&#34;Sweet Charity&#34;, for me, anyway, never gained proper momentum, failing even to give MacLaine the stage she is capable of owning. I think there were too many Van Gogh/Picasso-inspired directorial decisions made by Fosse to showcase what he thought was &#34;art&#34;. His artistic license should have been revoked before he began this film, because it was truly a disaster. Of course, this genre isn't quite what the actress is known for, and I can't see why she wanted to be a part of this musical cacophony in the first place. Go figure...<br /><br />Never again! I suppose it takes a &#34;certain kind&#34; to like this sort of tripe, so I'll stick to my silent film epics and REAL classics up through the 1940's; at least, I know it won't be weird! Fritz Lang's silent classic, &#34;Metropolis&#34;, 1927, will be on in a few days. I'll get the popcorn and butter and meet you on TCM. Hail to the classics!<br />~~Eddie"

A movie worth watching but it seemed to be a bit of a tear jerker and a children’s movie ~ 4.8stars rating given by Amazon customers (a  near perfect movie) holy cow! 🐄 I’ll have to start ignoring the consensus of the general public ~ great set location scenery! Almost 9 minutes of previews & ADVERTISEMENTS at the beginning of the movie compliments of greedy corporate scum & we’re not allowed to access top menu 💩Amazon rated at 4.8 stars ⭐️ ?almost perfect right up there w the classics!? People try watching movies with out smoking crack before rating them

"I started watching this show on t.v.  I learned that it was a series from years ago, and started recording the shows so I could watch them when I got home from work.  My dvr  started deleting some shows, due to space, and turns out, it deleted many episodes of FNL!!😠😠<br />  Luckly, I found the series, book, and movie on Amazon.  LUCKY me!!<br />I bought all three, and watched the movie, and series.  Now all that is left is to read the book."

But had this weird indentation after I took it off.👀????idk man.  It plays fine but still."

"Finally bought the Blue Ray DVD to this movie, after all these years, that I have loved since it came out in 2013. I read the entire series before this film was made. And I am still quite upset that the movie franchise was not continued.<br /><br />I had no interest in watching the TV series though..Which was wise since it was canceled after 3 seasons anyway..<br /><br />I'm loving the extra features on this DVD and the behind the scenes info and deleted scenes. And how it's all presented here.<br /><br />This film/DVD has me feeling like a kid on Christmas morning 😇🤣"

I love this movie. I saw this with my grandpa and it touched both of our hearts. Mainly because it brought about so many memories for him. He related with the boys in so many moments and even remembered running against McFarland when he was in high school track. So thank you Disney for making this movie 💛💛

I've seen and greatly enjoyed these movies in the theater and wanted my own copies. But local retailers wanted $25 for each movie! Amazon had a great price on this set that I couldn't resist! Amazon rocked it AGAIN! 😁

"I've been a fan of Pippi Longstocking since I was 8. Bad news I never saw this movie as a kid. I even had a 'kid crush' on Tami Erin. Glad Amazon had this movie. I not only bought the movie ta watch with my niece, but I bought another cause one of my coworkers enjoyed watvhing it, too. Tami Erin (dare ta say) did a just as much, if not, a more awesome job than Shirley Temple did! An that covers alot of ground. Too bad there wasn't a &#34;Pippi Longstocking 2&#34;. Or I wuld've got that, too. 😎"

Nude Nuns With Big Guns is a awesome off the wall biker revenge movie. If you like crazy B grade grindhouse action movies this one is for you. It is about a outlaw biker club Los Muertos who are dealing drugs with the help of corrupt nuns and other leaders of the church. When part of a shipment is found stolen by a nun. The biker club takes one and puts her in to prostitution and they have her hooked on drugs. She escapes vows revenge on the biker club and all the currupt members of the church. She sets out on a killing spree. This is one hell of a movie full vengeance  beautiful women and as the title says a lot of nudity what more do you need for great B grade cult classic.<br />5 🌟

I had the two disk special edition before and it came with an outer paper cover as advertised and this one did not. The movie case itself is also not well taken care of and there are marks and pencil scrapes all over the plastic screen. Holes in the back of the plastic cover. The DVD itself is pretty okay though 🙏🏼 I expected more since it was a “new” or “like new” copy which it wasn’t /:

"I've heard all the pros and cons of this movie so I being a fan of classics, science fiction, time travel and history I decided to watch it myself with the family.  I was very impressed with how great the movie was made, flowed quite well and the theme throughout the entire movie made me really think.<br /> H.G Wells would be proud!

I was very impressed with how great the movie was made, flowed quite well and the theme throughout the entire movie made me really think.<br /> H.G Wells would be proud!  The music used was the best pick.  Would highly recommend it!  I give it 5 stars!  😀"

"No matter what you think of Brie and her social and political convictions it’s a great marvel movie and sets up more of the cosmic marvel universe to be explored. Most people give this film low grades as they don’t like Brie the actress, 🤷‍♂️  People need to get over it and just enjoy the movie."

"A great movie 🎥 that has endured time ❗️<br />Also, the second disc tells little know facts about the making of Casablanca as well as many of the actors . Lauren Bacall as narrator is a excellent choice for the task . ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

"Disney has completely destroyed Star Wars😡 Star Wars was George Lucas' own fantasy. Disney has killed off just about every original cast member as well as each movie becoming worse. Luke Skywalker was to be the main hero of George Lucas' fantasy and Disney kills him off while putting more and more annoying and lame characters into the series. Disney continues to put out garbage, just as they do with almost all of their TV shows, completely stupid shows with dumb plots, paying people to be the shows that can't act.  Walt must be rolling in his grave. Star Wars should have ended after the first three, if not the first six. Shame on Disney. 😡😡😡"

"I was so looking forward to my favorite genre Bond James Bond!  Ugh!!!  I've read all the reviews on Amazon and everyone who gave this movie 1 star are so correct!!!<br />I was so upset after this movie.  The ending, the middle and the beginning...from the song in the beginning to the horrible ending.  The writing is horrible, it's 1 hour way too long, and my favorite Daniel Craig...well...spoiler alert**** dies.  So depressing!!!  We do go to the movies to escape reality, don't bring reality into my movies😫😫😫"

My hubby and I watched this movie last night and I have to say that this was a very good movie plus it was entertaining. Now I do agree that the original was better but what made this movie interesting was MR boogeyman bc I like that this movie didn't explain who it was just the fact that it's a scary monster. Maybe in part 3 the story will conclude by showing us who or what me boogeyman really is. I think it's scary when you they don't have a back story . the performance are very good. The movie murders the children made were very creepy. I thought the messed up one was the church murder . the stupid murder movie the child made was snow murder. Like I said if you like a entertaining movie especially a R rated film and it's not pg-13 then this is a movie for you. Wait for this movie to be on sale for a penny so you can say you some money 🎥😉

"I actually had no idea this movie existed until I Googled Sarah Wright after seeing her in American Made and THIS movie was on her list of movie credits. It was pretty good. I don't know who filled out that yellow dress better, Elizabeth or Sarah. Didn't get too many shots of Sarah, but got PLENTY of Elizabeth. Great shape, and that booty,😍WOW!!  💛 Turn that heart upside down and that's IT. ""You can't block a boop-boop with your hand""🤣 Funny stuff."

"Saw this in the library and decided to borrow it. Very glad I did! Watched it twice so far.  If you love action films with car chases and explosions, then this is NOT the movie for you, lol!<br />On the other hand, if you loved Call Me by Your Name... Remains of the Day... A Brief Encounter (1945) or read Quartet in Autumn by Barbara Pym....OR if you just LOVE British films as I do, then you might really enjoy this.<br />It's not a romance...but it's a movie about emotions, choices, life and the paths people take. It's subtle.... you have to get into the minds of the characters. There are some tough themes, loneliness.... despair (it's not a ""feel good"" film) -  but it's very well acted. It feels very real. ""Ordinary life,"" yet it has so many layers. I would definitely recommend it if you like ""quiet films"" with a lot going on under the surface. One slight word of caution:  I was a little mixed up (at first)  regarding who they were referring to when they'd mention various character's names ...but as it goes on, everything becomes perfectly clear. 🙂"

"I have a diverse Blu-ray 3D library, and while DreamWorks films aren't always my priority when it comes to beefing up my collection - I have yet to be disappointed. It's hard to think of a DreamWorks 3D presentation that is sub-par, so I'm never shy about skipping a film in theaters, but picking it up to watch at home instead. The Boss Baby is no exception to that rule - it uses 3D in a beautiful, fun way that really immerses you into the imaginative world of the movie. I had fairly low expectations going in, and I'm happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. I recommend this title for anyone who wants to add a silly animated film with a stellar 3D presentation to their library. It's certainly not a Disney film, but that doesn't mean it isn't a lot fun. 👶🏼"

"I LOVED THIS MOVIE! It resonated with me. I have several dogs I love very much and have had several over my life as my parents have always been long time animal lovers and dog lovers. Pets have played big roles in my life and this gives them a perspective that we play a huge role in their lives too. It's not a one sided deal. They are one aspect of our big world but we are a HUGE aspect of theirs or almost the only aspect of theirs. It gives us the chance to see how they see and to appreciate them for that. I love that about this movie.<br /><br />I'd recommend bringing lots of tissues as my friend and I cried lots and lots. Might not be a fab family movie but I wouldn't say it's bad either because it does teach a respect for animals that they aren't just play things that you can get bored of and throw away, they are responsibility. Maybe not the best for super young audiences because of all the sad parts.<br /><br />I wouldn't listen to rotten tomatoes on this one at all. It's way off. It's totally worth the buy and I wish I had seen it in theaters. You might find a new understanding when you look at your dog after watching this movie! It's 100% worth watching! 10/10 👌👏💯"

In spite of all the other reviews this is the second worst Spider-Man I have ever looked at if I remember correctly Peter Parker graduated from high school and was no longer running the halls with the rest of those wild geek kids but apparently this Spider-Man in homecoming doesn't want to recognize that .. and the Spider-Man and homecoming Spider-Man are two of the worst Spider-Man movies I have ever looked at and was so glad I got them by mistake because I quickly quickly returns them for a refund.. and purchased the Amazing Spider-Man which is a whole lot better and I highly recommend that one more and even more so then this movie.. so unless you are still in junior high or High School this is specifically for those level of yours.. unless of course you are one of those die-hard Spider-Man fans that just buys anything that has Spider-Man marked on it.. so for my rating I give it 5 thumbs down..👎👎👎👎👎

I grew up listening to this music as my parents listened to it. I continued listening to it and loving it throughout the 70s as well. I have now have collections and still listen to it to this very day! 🤗 My daughter knows it also bc she grew up listening to it as I played it. I've always loved the music behind the Motown songs..... ALWAYS. I will now listen to it with So Much Greater Appreciation and Respect. Certainly the songs would not be what they are without THE Amazing Musicians. 💯 Thank you Funk Brothers for your music. Thank you sir for their story. 👏👏👏👏🔥👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾🎀🎈🎁🎤🎹🪗🎵🎼🎺🎷🎸📻🪕🥁🎙️📽️🎟️🎬🎥🎼📷 and a Standing Ovation.

"Well, the only way I can see this movie getting negative reviews is if the reviewers were paid to dump on it! This movie kicks ass! Not only was it quite an original script, but the acting was believable, and the effects were great, considering it was an indie production! I found this far more entertaining than the crap that Hollywood produces. Derek Lee is tremendous as the &#34;afflicted&#34; one in this movie. Hats off to Derek Lee and Clif Prowse for their efforts! My ten bucks was well spent, and I look forward to multiple viewings. I only hope that the Derek/Clif legacy doesn't stop here. Congrats gentlemen! 💀"

Bought this movie as a memoir. I have seen this movie at least 8 times and had it in VHS form (say what?!?!) 😁 Thought I'd better upgrade to dvd. Still have my VHS player though! 😉

The movie 🎥 depicted exactly what it should have . I find it wonderful when an artist allows us into their lives and bares all. It helps me understand and love them more for being so....different. And now legendary. All my love ' Purple one '

"An excellent script (politics aside and minimal). Daniel Craig with a Texas accent? He did it. The casting was superb. Hints are not overdone. Most are subtle, a few are clear. This movie deserves to be watched again. Humor is well interspersed. Heaving takes on a new dimension. Human nature descends, and that’s “when the Knives come Out!” Kudos to Rian T. Johnson 👏"

"I personally didn’t care for it 👎🏻 She didn’t give me that strong woman vibe. (I do like her in her other movies) To me She just seamed a little too lost and didn’t live up to the roll. Yes I understand this is different take on the Laura Croft character, even still she just wasn’t “bad a**” enough. Angelina Jolie made the roll. Laura Croft is an Icon because of her!  She was tough, confident and oozed sex appeal. That’s hard to beat. - I’d give it a 3/5"

Fun movie. Totally kid appropriate. Great animation. Kids LOVE it. Good message and optimistic main character. Kids can never remember the tune of the song for very long so I hear them humming variations of it for a week until it drops out of their mind completely. 😂

"This movie was such a waste of my time. It deserves zero star. For a ""Christian"" movie, this thing was so filled with filth it was disgusting. The story line is absolutely appalling with no depth.  It portrayed the black community in a very disturbing way which is not typical of the families I know and live with.  How do you as a black actor sign up for such filth? That story is so poorly written it made absolutely no sense. There was no character development, just the same stereotype type about blacks which Hollywood and the media love to shove down our throats. Wished I could take back that hour and a half wasted on this disturbing movie. I am absolutely appalled and wished there was a lower rating than a star. 😡 Smh!!!"

An old movie but was/is one of my children’s favorite because it’s not animated.  Do yourself a favor and watch it. Reindeer are real in this film.  Christmas tradition to watch 👍🏻

The sword and shield are not accurate and from a different series. It was a gift to my son and he noticed immediately :( 😕<br />Overall I thought the quality was good though.

"This movie was a surprise hit with our family. We initially streamed it through some service or other, and just picked it because it was family friendly but didn't know anything about it in advance. I think my husband and I laughed harder than the kids did! The characters are funny and endearing, the story is action-packed but sweet, and the humor appeals to kids and adults alike. We loved it so much it's one of the few movies we bought on DVD/Blu-ray this year!<br /><br />WOLFPACK, FORM OF...SUBMARINE! 😂"

"There was Nothing I disliked. Although the show itself was only three seasons, I loved watching this family saga when it started on Touched By An 👼.  Very unique family + excellent actors. Highly recommended ☺"

"I’m a youngster and I finally saw this movie on Amazon. I knew then I had to order the DVD. The man who played Christ did well, because Christ walked this earth with so much love. You can even feel the emotions of Christ as HE looked out for HIS people. The most powerful scene is the part where Christ gave water to Judah Ben Hur and the head of the Romans came to Christ saying “You! No water for him!” Chris kept giving him water. So he charged at him and Christ stopped him in his place. That’s a reminder from GOD. Never come against HIS sheep. 🐑 HE will always be our SHEPHERD and guide us along the way!"
This is my favorite Jamie Lee Curtis film. Her dance scene is cool to watch but my favorite scene in the whole movie is at the prom when Wendy leaves Lou on the dance floor dancing by himself while everyone is just laughing at him. Cracks me up every time. 😆 Lou was a cool character.  👍

This is an outstanding movie and truly worthy of your collection and will truly keep you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end.. I give it 10 big stars ..<br />In fact these are the guys that should make the next Star Trek movie.. I believe it would look more real than all the previous movies put together .. and the USS Enterprise would probably look a hundred times better..👍👍👍👍👍
I've been buying movies online since I can't find them here so its great knowing they are a good price and new. They also ship fast 👍👍👍

"I like the overall moral of the story. The idea of having a universal remote for life is cool, but just like any device there are always technicalities, malfunctions, and difficulties sometimes.<br /><br />  Christopher Walken (Morty) was great for his role as (Angel of Time) to teach a multi level lesson on life, to Michael (Adam Sandler) family man; rushing through life.<br /><br />Take time to sit back with this comedic moral outlook.🤔😉😀"

"As shabby as it got towards the end of its run, and despite the horrific job on the pilot episode this series is fun and for the most part animated as well as the original Josie and the Pussycats. Creative aliens and their unique world's as well as the cool science fiction plots make this a &#34;must have&#34; for any collector.  The stories suffer a bit with the loss of the Ruby/Spears team, but still a Nobel entry.  Now let's get them to release Scooby-Doo meets Josie and the Pussycats on dvd. 😊"

Exactly what I wanted 👍👍👍
"All the cd's worked great! BUT, I was disappointed with the second season of the show. What happened!? Did all the writers quit??? A lot of the actors from the first season were just GONE and the new ones they brought in, all were just very badly writen, AND directed. The stories were also lousy, poorly writen, not thought out at all, it seemed. Season One, was GREAT!! 👍🇺🇸"

"This is a great film, which is the reason I bought it in April 2016. But lo and behold when i go to play my 3-DVD set I get the message &#34;wrong region&#34;, so I check the back of the case and find it is made for regions 2 + 4. Now why Amazon would not alert a US buyer to the fact that the product is not compatible to US devices is truly incomprehensible. Now I'm stuck with a movie that I need to make a trip around the world to watch because I didn't assume I would be sold a movie I would be unable to play in the US, so I didn't play it within the 14 day return period. Digital material that is zone dependent should be given extended return periods because MOST people buy items for the particular region they live in. And not everyone pops things out of the box as soon as it's received. But I certainly will from now on; since Amazon plays this &#34;seller&#34; game with no holds barred. What a rip!!!👎🏾"

Bought for a friend.<br />I enjoyed it more in the 80s. Humorous.<br />A little exciting. Great score. Elongated episode.  Spock and Jim moments.👍🏾<br />Uhura has less to say. Dr. Bones sarcastic humor in tact. Montalbon can be laughable or serious. You pick.<br />Not a superb film but good popcorn flick.

"I accidentally received the version of this movie that Paramount recalled. It's not terrible by any means but there's a glaring editing error at the beginning. It wouldn't bother most, but as a huge fan of this movie it does really stand out to me.<br /><br />As previous reviewers have stated, if you receive the version of this movie with a YELLOW BAR CODE, it is the fixed, reissued version, and the original release with the editing problem has a WHITE BAR CODE. I'm surprised Amazon is still supplying these but I will try to see if I can get a proper replacement 👍🏼"

I knew very little about B. Potter prior to watching this film. I read a bit about her after watching the movie.  Fascinating & clever lady who knew how to get what she wanted.... while fighting the horrible Victorian Era attitudes about women!  I felt terribly sorry she never got to marry the young man she loved because her parents thought @ age 32 she wasn’t mentally mature enough to choose a husband.  She was by then a renowned author & artist & her parents treated her like a silly school girl.  Women had no rights in the Victorian age😞.

I enjoyed this movie!!👍👍 Great cast....OMGoodness! I laughed and I cried.  I didn't expect the shocker.....didn't see that coming at all!  I wish there was more time with the couple that ended up together though. I think this is a movie that men might not admit they like but might admit they can relate to. Will watch again and definitely recommend!

"One of the TOP 10 Rom-Coms in the History of film! And kudos to Criterion for giving it its DUE.<br /><br />However (Can I be honest?), that COVER...is an EYESORE! It is HIDEOUS! HowEVER did they choose it, and WHY?? It references an incredibly great scene in the movie, but then DEBASES it w/a cartoon that doesnt remotely LOOK like the actors, doesn’t have an overall pleasing effect on anyone, and is grossly UNjust to these stars due to this mismgmt of their likenesses furthr offends them because this inartful rendition of their likenesses also happens to be  grossly unflattering, to the point of being intentionally CRUEL to Ms. Stanwyck; a beautiful, intelligent and alluring woman who deserves far better than this barbaric mockery of her many gifts.<br /><br />Nonetheless, what a FABULOUS FILM underneath, that NO ONE should leave UNSEEN (many times). 🤓"

Troubled by disturbing visions and paranoid delusions, he and his wife (Alma) begin to suspect that the haunting memories are the machinations of a bizarre, perverted cult that reside on the other side of the island. The leader of this group may hold the key to the artist's delusions.<br /><br />𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒍𝒇’s affinity for aloofness begins with its title. Research, such as that conducted by Professor Birgitta Steene, has led some to suggest it is derived in part from Swedish folklore. Such sources more specifically refer to a period of time occurring between midnight and 1 A.M. that is known as the ‘ghost’ or ‘witching’ hour because this is when supernatural entities are believed to be in their most powerful state.<br />Related in part: In Nordic mythology there is a pair of inseparable wolves named Skoll and Hati who relentlessly hunt the sun and moon with the hint of devouring them whole. Tethered to one another, this duo of canines respectively represent the forces of enlightenment, civilization, ignorance, and chaos.<br />This dichotomous aura of influence is reflected in part by a novella that inspired Bergman that was written in 1815 by E.T.A. Hoffman. Entitled 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑮𝒐𝒍𝒅𝒆𝒏 𝑷𝒐𝒕, it follows the story of of a student named Anselmus who becomes romantically involved with a Veronika and Serpentina though the flow of attraction between each party varies; the former is a human who falls in love with Anselmus after seeing him for the first time, and the latter is originally a snake who entrances Anselmus after he looks directly in her eyes by chance.<br />If not obvious by their descriptors,  the center of these conflicting attractions exploits a marked discrepancy between fantasy and realism, and this lends to artistic expression overall as an escapist tightrope for those in need. As is the case with  𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑮𝒐𝒍𝒅𝒆𝒏 𝑷𝒐𝒕’s protagonist, Johan is plagued by visions that make one question his reliability as a narrator, with the empathy had for his sensational and emotional pandiculations varying between the parties of Alma, Veronica, and the cult members aforementioned above. For what it is worth, Johan’s nonsensical ramblings that serve as tragic exposition were inspired by experiences Bergman had growing up: Namely, recollections of having been reprimanded at a young age by his parents in a psychologically harmful way.<br />Funny enough, returning briefly to 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑮𝒐𝒍𝒅𝒆𝒏 𝑷𝒐𝒕, it was written at a point considered to be the most traumatic for Hoffman as he witnessed copious amounts of violence first-hand that were perpetrated during the Battle of Dresden, and he commented further that his authorship centered around fantasy “removed him from the stress and pressure of external events”. One could subsequently argue that Johan in some ways 𝒓𝒆𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒔 to the ‘hour of the wolf’ and projects it as validation that what has haunted him in the past and continues to do so in his adult life isn’t just a figment of his imagination.<br />(As an aside, it is noted that Bergman was inconsistent in discussing abuse he endured growing up during interviews in that the severity stayed the same with the main perpetrator - his parents or siblings - being what changed amongst his related accounts. It is almost as his disclosures were in fact guided by an unexplainable sense of discretion,  and this applies to Johan’s behavior in 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒍𝒇’s turn of events.)<br /><br />In becoming acquainted with Johan's nightmares the audience becomes invested in Alma’s<br />Although more blank-slated than nuanced,  Liv Ullmann’s expressions act as an emotionally transient portal that becomes strengthened by the fluidity of her character's resistance.<br />Art being such a tragedy of self-reflection, easily forgotten is  𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒍𝒇’s diegetic context: A moving picture placed overtop a collection of discovered diary entries and indecipherable paintings.<br />Seen is the interpretation of such sources through a series of verbal interludes viewers are not made privy to, as evidenced by an off-screen film crew heard first thing and interactions that suggest Alma is speaking (As assuredly as possible, given what she describes) for the purposes of an interview or documentary.<br />The mysterious entities of which she ruminates is inconsequential compared to the harsh universality of her plight. Capable of penetrating and splintering the most stable of intimate affairs, perceived ineptitude as a life partner hovers above and orchestrates a tunnel of terror underneath. There becomes such sorrow attached to Alma’s acceptance of a partner being too far gone: No longer merely of earth, but possessed by something beyond that can’t be simply expelled away at will. And to feel a sense of culpability or heightened leverage of responsibility in regards to Johan’s predicaments that start as internalized concerns: that is the real antagonist of 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒍𝒇 when all things are said and done.<br /><br />The first clue as to how much Johan’s mental health is declining is slightly niche as it is hidden in 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑴𝒂𝒈𝒊𝒄 𝑭𝒍𝒖𝒕𝒆: An opera performed by Wolfgang Mozart that debuted in 1789 that is present in cameo-esque fashion. Early on Johan divulges information related to his visions, and he makes a point of saying the scariest of them all takes the form of a man known to him as ‘Papagino’.  Public reception of 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑴𝒂𝒈𝒊𝒄 𝑭𝒍𝒖𝒕𝒆’s has suggested that its version of Papagino tends to be a fan favorite owing to the intermissions of comic relief he provides during particularly tense acts: Not to mention he is certainly the least polarizing of Mozart’s ensemble in terms of who is ‘good’ or ‘bad’, and his desire to be happy is satiated by merely the presence of a “good meal and a good woman”.<br />These two incentives specifically, as they are related to sociable security in some way, informs Johan’s deterioration as a manifestation of artist-fueled precariousness. The price one pays for openly artistic expression is a double-edged sword as it invites a show of support from a larger community of witnesses that can easily twist into a humiliating quell of critique. As such, the cliquey dynamic that Johan and his wife are pulled into is arousing to the point of discomfort (Sidenote, shout out to the dinner party table scene for a hefty dose of over-stimulation 🥴🥴🥴), and largely because of how privy audience members become to the praise and reassurance that Johan hopes to acquire that is paired with mockery and indignity in tandem.<br />As personified with its jarring composition at every turn, 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒍𝒇 seldom takes a moment to “cut to the chase”, and coincidentally enough serves as insight in to the romantic relationship Bergman and Ullmann had during production and beyond that over the course of five years proved tumultuous when spoken on by the latter party. According to Ullman, a majority of the time she spent with Bergman was in isolation from others on the island of Farö despite knowing such residency wouldn’t constitute as a “safe space” for her, and this more forcibly connected her own feelings of security to the more validating components of romantic or interpersonal courtship, if not something more. Paired with 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑴𝒂𝒈𝒊𝒄 𝑭𝒍𝒖𝒕𝒆, which thematically ponders love as a joint effort through tribulations and sacrifices that can make one a better person, informs Alma’s desire to support Johan at the risk of heartbreak or her own well-being.<br /><br />A mosaic of intrusive thoughts gone awry, 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒍𝒇 certainly fairs as a tour of misunderstood genius or pretension if approached with absolution as opposed to curiosity. Moving without a steady hand of ebb and flow, ingested is the potentially ambiguous nature of suffering by both primary and secondary players so as to explore a cognitive dissonance that is fertilized by an ill-perceived world and external strife: So much so that the literal detachment of one’s face can represent temporary freedom from such stressors and more. 𝑯𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝑾𝒐𝒍𝒇 is very much about masking and the strategies people use to hide away from the world, and Bergman’s personal affairs bring the points it makes full circle. In less capable hands it would be little more than a bloody or two-faced mess."

"I'm pretty upset that it turns out this only offers closed captioning in French! 😐 We have just started the series, and while we love the acting etc, my husband and I rely on closed captioning so we don't miss out on any of the dialogue. Sadly, as mentioned at the onset, this version seems to only offer CC in French (??)"

"This is a classic. This is a true event. The Isle of Eriskay, the real isle, is replaced by the fictional Todday (as in Hot Toddy). The people are hampered by ""the sabbath"" and this movie does a very believable job of conveying that the islanders really did believe. Scenes of them standing and dumbly staring at what they most desire in life is brilliantly juxtaposed with their faith. Then (smiles) the sabbath is over ... their unbridled joy seems so real. FEB stands for F'ing English B@stard and Scottish distain for the English really comes across.<br />The newer version is hampered by their desire to diss the church and all who have faith. Overall, the black and white version is the one you'll enjoy watching. 😉<br />Only con is that it needs subtitles as an honest-to-God Scottish dialect can be hard to understand."

"This movie followed the book word for word.  With it's spectacular fighting scenes to its romantic scenes, it showed the viewers what they came to see. Although, many did not like this movie...don't be tricked. Yes, there is blood shown, but if you read the book, you realize that's how it's supposed to be, but better and not as violent and graphic!( mainly because they had to make the movie PG-13 not R).  If you want to understand all of your questions, READ THE BOOKS! It will all make sense if you just take a little bit of time and read 1,2,and 3. Some people complain about the ending... Well, if you want to know what happens next, read THE MOCKINGJAY! It will explain it all there.<br />I loved this movie because they turned a great book, into a great movie. That's what I want to see being a true hungergames fan!😊"

"Love this flick. When my friends were trying to convince me to watch it, they had a hard time because just about anything they said could have been a spoiler. Now I find myself in that same position with this review.<br /><br />So watch it. You won't be disappointed. It's clever and scary with little touches of humor at just the right beats.<br /><br />I think that's all I can say...<br /><br />Oh! It stars Thor before he was Thor. There ya go! A solid detail about the movie that's not a spoiler! 😆"

RISEN is one of the best movies of Jesus I have ever seen! Joseph Fiennes plays a Roman Tribune investigating the alleged Resurrection of Jesus. Pilot and Caiaphas want a body. The Tribune searches all over and finds Jesus alive and is changed forever. The movie is similar to The Robe with Richard Burton and Victor Mature but only vaguely. What happens after will inspire and encourage you! If you liked Jesus of Nazareth you will like RISEN! This a must see this movie! 🌄😇⛪🌅💒

The ballet dancer at 1hr 48min is awesome and I think he deserved better mention in the credits.<br /><br />Carousel did not go over very well in the 50's because of the death and the ghost coming back.  Too dark for they day.  Fast forward 60 years and we see a wife beater, a wife neglector, and a man who slaps his child's hand for not accepting his gift, even though he was a stranger to her.  To add insult to injury, one of the songs say even though they were hit, it didn't hurt.  😱  Jigger was a jerk.<br /><br />So that was a real distraction.<br /><br />The above put aside, I enjoyed it.  The supporting cast lifted the movie up.  Once again, the choreography was breath taking."

"Was super excited to find this title on Blu-ray only to find out it’s regioncode 2 and won’t play on my Oppo BDP-83 in the US (not sure how other reviewers in the US are able to play it and I’ve searched for workarounds, maybe newer players do or there’s a PC fix?) I still haven’t given up hope, maybe I’ll figure it out someday 😕"

The Muppet movies are among my family’s favorites. Go-to choices for all ages! And as we’re spending extra time inside together these days (and evenings) having such “choice” movies are well worth their price! 😉👍

"Totally Hilarious Film!<br />I remember seeing this once at the local theater and later on at the drive-in the following year.  Crazy funny Movie in my opinion! And at the time it was great to see Hawn and Chase together again after Foul Play. Charles Grodin is hilarious as Goldie's Husband. If you want a laugh on a gloomy day, this Neil Simon comedy classic will do the job.<br />This dvd is replacing my dvd+R recorded version off TCM from 20 years ago.<br />Picture quality and sound are excellent. Excellent price....what's not to like! Buy it....laugh a little!<br />👍👍👍👍👍<br />✌♥️🙂"

"Its a good film. However, I don't care for all too much dialog in it. The countdown is not really needed since we all know how to. It has many good features where as seen before on TV. It can be recommended. I will be using it for personal consumption.<br />👍😎👍☀"

Movie was set for out of country use. I live in America and had to return the movie and was unable to get a copy for the USA. Very disappointed 😞.
"I did not know much about this movie except no one seemed to like. So maybe I went in thinking I would not watch much. I have a few questions now about what happen to Earth 1. Whats going on there? Was there an infection? I would have liked to have seen that story too about how the bounty hunter got them. I do see how it wastes half the movie to get to the action. A whole 86 days of not much going on. However, with that said it is literally zombies in space and I am all for it. I have seen worse zombie movies and better, but never zombies in space. 🙂😊😀"

Wow! This has to be one of the top ten worst movie ever!  It rates 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮. Or better yet 💣💣💣💣💣  I’ve seen Bruce Willis play many different roles throughout his career. This one is going to be hard to unsee.

"I pre-ordered this and read the entire description to see how the part 3 was remade for 3D and it didn't say ANYTHING. Now it says a 3D TV and 3D Blu Ray player are required, why didnt you just redo it with the original 3D so people can actually watch it in 3D 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 kinda mad and then, amazon sent me an email saying I won't recieve it until the 27th anyways when my birthday is the release date so it was a present to myself. Thanks."

"I was SO excited to find this movie again! My Mom originally taped this on VHS for me, and I used to watch it all the time when I was little! It's funny to watch it again as a adult, Alice is always barging in to the lives of these strangers and telling them all how rude they are! I always loved the scene where Alice tap dances with Sammy Davis Jr. With an all star cast, this movie is a gem through and through. Pure nostalgia!💗"

"This was a made-for-TV movie from mid 80s and delivers an IMPRESSIVE line-up of actors. Delightful for all ages. We love watching it over and over again, but occasionally our copy grows legs (love to share good movies with friends & family ;) Thankfully, Amazon carries it as a regular item at a good price so we dont mind to buy again. Give it a try- So delightful 😊"

The first time I watched this movie I was about 9 years old. I had rented it from blockbuster 6 or 7 times but when blockbuster closed down I had no were else to rent the movie 6 years later I found the movie on Amazon and just had to buy it. In my opinion it is one of the best versions of Alice in Wonderland out there. The acting is great and the songs are catchy😊 It's still one of my all time favorite movies😊

This movie is so boring.  The dialogue is poor and the story line doesn’t line up with the book.  I fell asleep watching it.  The French  don’t know how to make good movies.  Wasted $8 😔...

It was good. I was pleased with the quality and I'm glad it came with extras in the special features besides a theatrical trailer 👍🏾

It didn’t specify on the add that the copy would only work in Canada and Europe. It would have cost as much as I paid for it to send it back so it went in the round file🙁

Seriously one of the funniest movies ever made.<br />Harrison Ford is quite youngish in this. Must watch from beginning to end!😃

"It was cheaper to purchase the dvd, than it was to rent the movie! 🙀 I had never seen the movie and wanted to rent it, but the dvd can up in my feed and was so cheap that I bought it. Added bonus? Movie trailers, so fun to watch! Loved the movie. I found it to be a “Grittier” Superman, which made fun it watch from that perspective."

"Let's examine this without providing any Divergent (DV) spoilers...<br />First, why compare it to [[ASIN:B008602KQI The Hunger Games]] (HG)? It is difficult not to. Both are post-apocalyptic, take place in dystopias, ultimately embody the same messages, and target primarily the same viewership age. As a side note, I find it somewhat hopeful (rather than pessimistic) that the popular YA novels these films are based upon are set in these circumstances; it provides the opportunity for critical thinking about what our society should become, or more importantly, not become. Anyway, on to the contrasting...<br /><br />🏃 Action 🏂<br />If action is what you want, you'll get it in DV, although you'll need to be patient. DV isn't an action film per se, so if action is what floats your boat, maybe consider another movie.<br />The Hunger Games had some intense fight-to-the-death scenes, but Divergent wins in the action category.<br /><br />😭 Emotional impact 💔<br />Whereas HG tugs at your heartstrings with the death of Rue, DV somehow just didn't pull this off. Sure, people important to the protagonist are killed off in DV, but there was no parallel to the spreading flowers over Rue's body that worked so well in HG. Divergent does have more feel-good moments than HG, as when our heroine passes her many tests and wins her many battles.<br />Overall though, The Hunger Games wins in the emotional impact category.<br /><br />🙅 Plot 🙌<br />The first hour is not all that impressive. It starts to come together after that (DV is a long film at 139 minutes; oddly enough, HG is almost exactly the same duration). They do an acceptable job of keeping you guessing about who is wearing a white hat and who a black hat, which is one reason the 2nd hour is more engrossing. It is difficult to tell from either film which underground movement (against the powers that be) is stronger. The resistance in DV seems weaker (as only a tiny percent of the population is divergent), but neither film goes into enough detail about this. I guess that's part of the problem with doing trilogy films based on books: we can hope more will be revealed later, but they may not be able to squeeze it in. If you are looking for a love story, DV will be your cup of tea. The central theme of HG was very creative, but ultimately the plot of DV is just more complex (and thus more engaging, at least for me). Despite its teen vibe and the unshakable notion that I've witnessed most elements of it in numerous sci-fi productions, Divergent wins.<br /><br />🚺 Actors 🚹<br />Divergent did okay with casting, but HG did better. I have the benefit of being able to judge this without the bias of having read either of these YA novels. Jennifer Lawrence (HG) is difficult to beat as the central character, but Shailene Woodley (DV) also excels in her role as the girl who didn't ask to be a hero. It's practically a toss-up between the two films when taking into consideration all of the major and minor roles, but the caliber of actors seems to me superior in HG.<br /><br />🎬 Cinematography 🎥<br />HG arguably had the better cinematography. DV did okay in its sets and locations, but the CGI distracted from the story at times.<br /><br />⏳ Urge to see next in the series ⏩<br />I saw the sequel to HG as soon as possible, but I have to say I am looking forward more to the DV sequel due to the plot possibilities. HG feels limited as to where it can go, being based around the games.<br /><br />So, which film is ""better""? That depends on what you want out of a film. If you are looking for an exact reproduction of the books on screen, then I have no idea. In the end it doesn't really matter which is better, since both films are worth watching. I rate them at 3.5 or 4 stars, with Hunger Games being marginally preferred."

If you love Tom Hanks you'll enjoy his early works too  Although he did perfect his facial communications as time went on but I just LOVE EVERYTHING he had done!!!! 💞😘💞.  ENJOY WITH POP CORN AND A COLD ONE 😃💞😎
"First I want to say that this movie came to me fast and in excellent condition.<br /><br />Underachiever Oscar (Will Smith) is a pint-sized fish with grand aspirations. When mob-connected great white shark Frankie (Michael Imperioli) is accidentally killed, Oscar concocts a story with Frankie's peace-loving brother Lenny (Jack Black) that it was he who murdered the shark. Suddenly hailed &#34;Sharkslayer&#34; by his aquatic brethren, Oscar has bigger fish to fry when Frankie's father, mob boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro), dispatches his henchmen to track down his son's killer.<br /><br />Doesn't quite sound like a cartoon but it is, and it happens to be one of my daughters favorites. She has been fascinated by it since she was 3. It's one of the only movies she would sit still for. Her old copy got lost so we bought her a new one. Did I mention she is 15 now? 😂<br /><br />This great movie also stars the voices of Angelina Jolie, Renee Zellweger, Martin Scorsese, Peter Falk, and many others."

This is a African American must as a kid for me released on my birthday in 1978 The Blu-ray is beautiful remaster sound quality great If you not seeing what I'm seeing maybe it time to Upgrade your TV Blu-ray player and Eye glass prescription 🤣 If you didn't like it It wasn't for you to begin with🤔 It's cast are some of the best at that time It is funny creatively done and Yes different then the Original as it should be! I Love it and I'm pleased Even though Amazon has it as Multi format which all you get is 1 Blu-ray disk my understanding that Multi format mean 2 disc and possibly a paper with a code to use like in Vudu or other stored movie sites

It was worth watching for a couple of startles but a very slow starting movie that I don’t think the screaming baby 👶 effect will catch on any time soon except coincidentally in the paranormal 2 movie-nice ending twist-Bluray picture clarity averaged 25 MBPS-grade B 🎥

"I had never heard of Alita before but watched the trailer and thought I must watch this. Bought the 4K edition and my son and I just finished it. We both loved this movie. Incredibly good. Fight scenes are well done and you can follow the action versus some films where the camera moves so much your just overwhelmed.  The character Alita is so wonderfully charming and powerful. The whole idea of opening your eyes to a new world and being so innocent but strong, then learning your origins and being true to them. Her visual appearance was perfect. It's impossible to not love her character as the film progresses. I will be rewatching this no doubt a few times. I want to learn more about the back story and what comes next too. I want to jump into this futuristic world and learn as much as possible. Simply well done and likely my favorite movie of the year. For me I know when a movie is great when I lose all track of time during the film. At the end when I look at the clock and ask myself where did the time go. Well this movie did just that. 👍"

"Totally, freaking amazing in every respect!<br />Looking at the Rotten Tomatoes score of 61% one has to ask how, why? Look at the ratings here on Amazon... Five stars!!!!! The acting is stellar, the production design is gloriously gargantuan, and gorgeous! The character designs are stupendously, and wildly creative....and the CGIs? FLAWLESS! This has become ultimately my undisputed favorite Sci-Fi film...EVER! There is insane action, fantastic fights, humor, innocence, fueled emotionalism, wisdom, deceit, love, romance, and self realization within this epic story! And this is just the beginning! OMG! PLEASE! Let there be sequels!!! Very true to Yukito Hishiro’s epic Manga comics, it’s baffling as to why this movie didn’t do as well in theaters here in the USA!?! ALITA makes Avengers ENDGAME look like the pure crap it ultimately is! Rosa Salazar is a dynamo of an actress, and it’s hard to notice that she is totally animated! Of course she acted the scenes out before the CGI was administered. She is by far one of my favorite actors! Waltz is in his finest form, and Jennifer Connelly is perfect. Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, and Jackie Earle Haley are kick-ass evilly terrific, and Keean Johnson is a standout as the doomed, idealistic cyber-jacker Hugo! I can’t say enough great things about this movie! It is a MUST SEE EPIC EVENT!! Thank you James Cameron, Jon Landau, and Robert Rodriguez! I would give this movie 10 stars out of 5 if I could! SEE IT NOW! 😺🎨🎸⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

"Most of the movies were great quality. We would like to give this less than four stars because unfortunately The Music Man didn't work at all and that's one of the movies we were most excited about showing our kids, but that's on us. We bought these far in advance for a road trip so we didn't know one of the movies didn't work until after the return window closed. I don't know how customer service is, but I'm sure it's not bad.<br />Other than that, we would have given 5 stars and we would still recommend to friends. Just don't be dumb like us and wait two months to check the quality 🤦"

"This movie was pretty good and hilarious!😆 My younger brothers also loved it as well. I think this is so far the best Lego Movie in many ways. But I kinda wished the Justice League had a bigger role like shown in the trailer briefly and in the other Lego Batman movie before this one. But despite that part, it's still an awesome and hilarious movie! I just love Batman! I heard they were actually gonna do Lego Batman 2 but it got cancelled sadly. 😔 I really wished and think they should reconsider it. I also really hope it's still possible for them to do it. This movie definitely deserves a sequel!"
"This movie was pretty good and hilarious!😆 My younger brothers also loved it as well. I think this is so far the best Lego Movie in many ways. But I kinda wished the Justice League had a bigger role like shown in the trailer briefly and in the other Lego Batman movie before this one.

"I already have Nightmare on elm street 1-4, i wanted as the picture implied 5-8 instead i got four completely different movies i also have all 8 Friday the 13th movies, this 4 movie set is worthless to me. I want a refund to be completely honest. False advertisement 😞 the sticker is incorrect, someone screwed up with the label, i just want what I spent my money for. 😢"

"I just finished watching the movie and it's good. As with most movies the book was better. It's a good movie but you miss so much of the &#34;dogs purpose' if you don't read it. The sequel is even better I laughed and cried while reading it. Yes good movie, but the book is better 😁🐕🐕🐶"

"Are you kidding me! I watched the trailer thinking that this will be an amazing movie. Little did I know that this was the most horrific, boring, slow, depressing movie of all time. There was some times where I laughed. But the majority of the time I wanted to punch the screen. I love dogs and I hate seeing them mistreated. Just my opinion!!! I hate hate hate hate hate the part when the fire was set. I laughed 0.00001% of the time. The rest I was crying my eyes out. Sorry, this movie is not for me.<br />Written by a very very angry 12 year old😡😡😤😤🤢🤢😨😨"

I purchased this item and when I got it out to watch on Christmas Day it did NOT work!  Made a funny sound and then a message appeared in what looked to be Spanish 😠. I tried it several times and on 2 different DVD players and got the same message.  I played other movies afterwards to make sure it wasn’t the DVD player.

I bought this last christmas but didnt watch it because I already watched it on tape.  When I tried to watch it yesterday it had no sound.  Its too last now to ask for a replacement.  Should have checked it when I got it 😟

"It was so bad I took it out before it even ended. Boring and all over the place. I’m shocked to see it has 4 and half star. I usually will try to pull through if a movie is bad but this one was just too painful to continue watching. Let me break it down for you. A girl was traveling to town and got hit by car. She went to live with the woman who hit her, then she gets visions and kept running all over town. Yup 😕 dunno 🤷🏻‍♀️"

"Being a big kid at heart I will admit I liked this film. 💥The use of puppets and humans what a great combination. You almost forget they are puppets and I believe that was the original intent. NOT for children as the profanity is common and some adult situations. As for the adults, sit back and enjoy this fun ride."

"This is a powerful, powerful, beautiful film. Unique. Similarities to Brokeback Mountain are MINIMAL at best. Someone wrote “you can smell the mud” but don’t be put off. It’s just a very realistic movie. The story is romantic and brilliantly acted, and the  direction is supreme—Francis Lee’s first film. It takes place in Yorkshire, so the Close Captioning is very helpful, even necessary, to understand the dialogue while watching it the first time, ‘specially fer us Amuricans (I think you’ll enjoy watching it many times!). I’m very glad I bought it. The PAL version has deleted scenes which Region 1 version does not have, a serious fall from grace. 😭<br /><br />P.S.  The DVD of this movie has close captioning, not subtitles. You have to access the CC through your TV remote, not your DVD remote ."
"This is a powerful, powerful, beautiful film. Unique. Similarities to Brokeback Mountain are MINIMAL at best. Someone wrote “you can smell the mud” but don’t be put off. It’s just a very realistic movie. The story is romantic and brilliantly acted, and the  direction is supreme—Francis Lee’s first film. It takes place in Yorkshire, so the Close Captioning is very helpful, even necessary, to understand the dialogue while watching it the first time, ‘specially fer us Amuricans (I think you’ll enjoy watching it many times!). I’m very glad I bought it. The PAL version has deleted scenes which Region 1 version does not have, a serious fall from grace. 😭<br /><br />P.S.

"This is one of the best musicals ever, and if you don't love it you're bad & you should feel bad. Eddie Murphy was robbed of his Best Supporting Actor 🏆, imho. However, Oscar recognizes a body of work & probably didn't feel he had enough dramatic parts behind him- unfair because these parts are less available to black actors. Imho.<br />Anyway, a stellar cast, music from heaven, and great dance numbers."

"I'm so sad, I love this movie and was so excited but I think I got a faulty DVD. It plays in French and Spanish but not in English which being it my first language, does me no good really. I've played with all the settings and nothing. All the special features work perfect, it's literally just the movie and just english. I'm so sad 😭"

"I saw the movie before reading the book and loved every minute of it. Norman Reedus playing the main character was a major plus. After reading the book however, I see that the movie is not so great. The reason for the 4 stars is mainly because Norman comes out.<br />If you haven't read Portrait of a Young Man Drowning, I recommend watching this movie, I'm sure you'll like it.<br />If you have read the book, I wouldn't recommend watching it. I can guarantee you'll be greatly disappointed - unless you just want to watch it to get your Norman Reedus fix 😉"

The movie arrived a day late in a yellow/orange envelope with bubble wrap. when I opened it the box was cracked😒 that is my only complaint!"

"I felt bad for the actors bc this movie really had the potential to be amazing. Sadly, it fell short bc of the screen play and editing and direction...and picks for certain characters; i.e. Simon.<br /><br />I've never read the books so I'm not tainted with biased, etc...the leads in Jamie and Lily were well-done.  Simon was annoying and superfluous; as was the moody, ridiculously explosive-with-attitude Alec about Jace. ( like I said, I didn't read the books, but regardless, Simon was so annoying it killed it for me for him. He needed to GO!)<br /><br />Some aspects of the script were just...eyerolling. Clary on the ground with a bite, she's circling the drain and gives this long sentence about Jace ripping his shirt off to bind her wounds.  Really?  That should've been written differently and more succinct.  Basically, SHORT and sweet. What off-set it was the response in Jamie.  It was a good chuckle.<br />The script/editing really killed  the film tho.  Diatribes from Clary to her dad about, if you were my dad you'd know where I was wishing the blah blah blah....you're not my dad and you never will be..."" OH, MAN. 🤦‍♀️  Wayyyy too long and oh, so, typically predictable.  Her constant apologizing to Simon.  For what!?  Again, script and or editing, the end scene with Clary and Jace.  He says he doesn't believe they're bro and sis...and she comes out with crap about how she now sees the world...!?  Wtaf!?  What does that have to do with anything he just said?  Yep, nooothing.  Then his verbage before credits about Hodge saying the stories were all real...huh?  Where the beep did that come from and wth does that even fit.  Much of the time, it felt like you were coming into scenes with lines being spliced haphazardly together and you're left to try and make sense of it. That's crap editing/directing for you.<br />Ok, one more,  Jace is getting the poop kicked outta him and cClary runs back to mama whose basically been blissfully out of it on the sofa...no harm...still all good..instead of going to help Jace. Really!?  Yeah, no. Mama can wait when the pending death of the dude  you love is about to get skewered like a BBQ'd weenie! Hello, car 54, where are you!?<br /><br />Ok, I lied, one more; the kiss scene with Jace and Clary.  Holy balls of batman!  The SONG destroyed the scene.  Really, some no name singer massacering some unknown pooper of a song...ahhhhh!!  I actually CRINGED!  The whole set up was very...childish and Disney-esque (I loathe Disney) esp for a more mature-themed film.  The whole scene just...ummph!...them chatting was good...still ""cringe"" worthy, tho.<br /> It could've been saved with a better song...or NO song at all.<br />The movie felt smooth in some areas and very choppy, like they were trying to fit too much in in too short a time, in others  EX: Alluding to Clary's powers but never really explaining anything.  Too much chop and not enough explanation and bang.  What did mama take that zonked her?  Why the he!! Is simon even there!?  Send the kid home...and it goes on.<br /><br />What saved the film was Jamie and Lilys chemistry and scenes and ability to pull off making things work as best they could under the circumstances.<br /><br />Ultimately, I would've liked to see where the series went.  Like Twilight, whose movies got better over time...I think that would've been the case for this series, as well.  Too bad the director, editor and screenplay tanked it out of hand.  Sad really. So much potential."

"I absolutely love this film! The writting is witty. The characters are quirky and fun. Its one of those movies where its more about the character development than the actual story. I mean, the story is almost inccidental. Its like a dark comedy on the set of friends! Cue that stupid song... (Ill be there for you) Lol. But really, its much more than that. There is so much going on, you trully need to have repeated viewings to catch all the funny gags that are running through this film. Ive seen it at least half a dozen times and im still catching stuff that went over my head the first time around. I have to say though, i watched this with one of my friends, (my drummer) he is kind of ADD, and he didnt much care for it. But as i mentioned, he is kind of ADD and doesnt have much of a sence of humor. So, may not be for everyone. But if you like dark humor, and like quirky character driven movies, you may get a kick out of this flick. I loved all the actors in the film. The ladies are beautiful and talented. So are the guys, without being too cliched. I.e. (Stereotypical jock, looser, geek, etc) They all do a great job. No bad acting or crappy dialog. Quick moving. You dont feel as if its dragging. Unlike some movies that you look at the time and go, jesus its only been half and hour!!! Im sure you know what i mean. If you dont, just put on ""The Room"". Ugh. Horrible. I would almost dare say its a good date movie, except, since its a dark comedy, maybe not a 1st date! Lol. Enjoy the mayhem... and sing... When im walking, i strut my stuff and im so strung out, im high as a kite, i just might, stop to check you out, let me go on, like a blister in the sun, let me go on, big hands i know your the one! 😉😂"

The only thing about this movie that is new to me is that I now have it on Blu-Ray. I absolutely love this classic. I’ve seen it many times at the theater and on VHS. That’s why I had to upgrade to Blu-Ray. 😁 The Princess Bride is a must-see for kids and adults alike. Great story telling. Great message.

"This is one of my all-time favorite stories on screen, EVER. In high school, I used to have it in my DVD player and I would watch/listen to it every morning while I was getting ready. I know it by heart. When my little girl was about 7, I knew that she needed to watch this movie! Of course, she adored it as much as I always have. The whole family (son and husband included) enjoyed it too. This is a GREAT family movie! The historical context is perfect for teaching about the great depression if you homeschool and the fact that it is based on a true story just makes the story hit home even more. (She wrote a book too, so check that out!) 😊😊😊"

Love this movie. Superior acting. The best version of Murder on the Orient Express I've seen. The only thing is they went a little overboard with the mustach 😊
Good movie 🎥 So many star's and I always like most of movie's with Johnny Depp in them. Worth buying !
"As other reviewers have noted, if you read the books, you may be dissatisfied with this film. I have never understood why so many actors want to play this character, but then feel the need to change it…Branagh wants to make him into more of an “action hero” than Christie ever wrote him. I found this and other variations from the original work to be distracting and unnecessary. If you really want to rework Agatha Christie for the modern viewer 🙄, I would suggest one of her literally dozens of lesser known works. For fans of the books, stick w David Suchet and his masterful interpretation of the character.."
The first movie was exciting and had a great story behind it. This led me to purchase the second one but this one was clouded by a lot of lude sexual overtones that cheapened the script. I purchased 3 thinking they may have improved the writing but I was very disappointed that they continued with an even poorer written piece. So much for sequels😕

"This movie catches so much 💩; in a time where ""multiverses"" are the thing. Many people probably dont know till this day about the end credit scene that could clarify some things... maybe. This is supposed to be the real life Mario bros that the video game is based off of, not the other way around! Yes, it is definitely not a great movie, but it's fun, and as a young child when it came out to cinema, it was pretty cool; and I liked it, still kinda do! Did you like it, or did you let someone else convince you that you didn't?"

"A feel good movie for people who don’t take things to seriously.  Nothing is this movie is realistic except for the recruiting part, but only partially.  I just kicked back and enjoyed this classic military comedy and I really had fun watching it.  A very good blu ray edition with really good visual quality.  I’m happy with it.  And I’ll probably watch over and over in the years to come.  🙂<br /><br />Pauli Shore at his all time best."

"I absolutely loved this movie - A Dog's Journey! I felt so many different emotions while watching this movie, sometimes I'd have a smile on my face while other times I would have tears in my eyes! This dog will live 4 different lifes as Bailey, Molly, Big Dog, & Max! His only mission is to protect Ethan's granddaughter CJ at any cost! Bailey's adventure through multiple lives is filled with love, friendship & devotion as he and CJ experience joy & heartache music & laughter! All around it's just a beautiful story that will tug at your heartstrings at times! Ethan is played by Dennis Quaid, CJ is played by Kathryn Prescott & the voice for the dog is provided by Josh Gad - the movie running time is almost 1 hour & 50 minutes! This is a must-see movie for any dog lover! 💙 🐶 💙"

This movie does not do Brian Clough justice. He was a phenomenal man but the masterminds who made this movie made him look silly. If Brian Clough was alive today he’d tell them where they could stick it! He’d also beat them over the head about how he’d sum their sorry selves up and I bet they’d go running home to their mommies crying afterwards...😭😭😭😭😭!!!!!!!!!

I’ve loved this film since 1993 when I purchased the laserdisc. So glad that it has bonus features old and new! Happy also because Intrada released the complete score minus the few vintage horror scores that were used. ❤️👍🏼
I always love kid movies & I thought this one was way too dag-on cute! 😂 I enjoyed the new school story line & the special effects were great.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing a part 2 if it ever makes it to production 🙂👌

"🤭 Bill Pullman is 100% credible as the charismatic US President.<br />This outstanding script (with all the ingredients that the studio heads had chided Oliver Stone about in his amazing Autobiography, Part One)  and the blazing Special Effects, as well as the Stars, are To Die For."

"This is a Great family friendly  movie without the blood, guts, sex, cursing, and violence. It is a reality check of today's society on the need for, or thirst for knowledge and revenge, and yet a need for the crazies of the world for blood and thrills.  I did like this movie, but for some reason was a little disappointed, maybe because  I had been waiting to see it for SO LONG. I had watched the trailer so many times, and I am obsessed  with shark movies, have seen them all, own them all.<br />I guess most of the Best scenes were already in the trailer preview  so it was a sneak peak, thrill kill so to speak :0  Great Special  Effects, as always Hollywood Scores Big !  Update: watched it again, Really do like this movie, it's  been so long since I watched it, it's  like watching it for the first time!! Can't say that about many films. Awesome, on the edge of your seat action, suspense and excitement and so many super great action scenes (cinematography) and chemistry  between  characters. Overall It is one of my favorite  movies. And because I own it, I can watch it when ever I want.  I unlike  other viewers found the lack of( blood and guts) gore being on the mild side very appealing  to a larger audience  and honestly who needs that, really it is unnecessary and repulsive.<br />So for those viewers who dislike this movie and find it boring, look else where for your guts, blood violence and sex!!!! This movie is not predictable at all, there are unexpected  twists and turns constantly and the story is actually  quite realistic. People are self centered and greedy and they always put themselves  first, it's  human nature. That's  a fact<br /> Thank God for the good people  in the world who self sacrifice  for the GREATER GOOD! Really is worth the Watch, and growing up on the beach, I find the ocean and Sharks fascinating, so I'm well educated about them and ocean life🤟"

"I had viewed this film many years ago when it debuted. The quality of the transfer to DVD was less than perfect, but it was a great trip down memory lane, and the death-dying and redemption themes were the important aspects, along with the Aussie Outback footage.  The “American traveling family” actors (except for the surviving boy) were weak then and did not get better with passing time. 😊 willian Holden, Rick Schroeder, and Jack Thompson carried the film."

The “American traveling family” actors (except for the surviving boy) were weak then and did not get better with passing time. 😊 willian Holden, Rick Schroeder, and Jack Thompson carried the film."
Great 🎥. Tom Hanks does a Great job!!

"Dark, dark, dark dark movie. But, I couldn't stop watching. Disturbing ending. Scary performances from Steen and Brando.<br />The movie takes you along a strange travel as you wonder what will happen next. The redux version, with the added French plantation scene, I thought, added to the movie.<br />Seeing a teenaged Laurence Fishburne was something that I had to do a double take on.<br />I asked a Vietnam vet how accurate it was. He said he was still undecided, but, he said ""Stay on the boat!"" . The vet was special forces and he did see 🐅 s."

"Very well done, these actors became these characters. Great movie!! Unfortunately it’s set in the 1970’s and it’s mirrorring what’s actually taking place today, it seems we’re going backwards instead of forward. This movie shows what can happen when insecure,unhappy,hateful people have a following and a little power, but it also shows that evil never really wins even when it thinks it is. The ending is heartbreaking and eye opening. 🖤"

This film is difficult to watch but very insightful.  It is a shame that violent act towards women still occurs in this part of the world.  We love and pray for our brothers and sisters in Iran 🤲💓🇮🇷

"(It took me a while to write this review because, honestly, there's so much great comedy in these 5 specials, I didn't know where to start. So let me preface my review by saying I have NEVER seen a comedian rattle off joke after joke, set after set, like Elayne Boosler. And the thing I love most about her comedy is you think she's hit you with the punchline, with the outrageous take on whatever situation she's talking about, and you laugh out loud, but then, without missing a beat, she hits you with an even more outrageous observation and you're belly laughing. Tears of joy are streaming down your face. Don't take my word for it-- even my 75 year old mother was crying she was laughing so hard through Broadway Baby!<br />Here's my attempt at doing this box set justice in words, which I could never do,  because it's THAT good. In short, buy it, watch it often.)<br /><br />Amazon should have a Golden Buzzer you can use once a year that allows you to give 10 Stars instead of a mere Five. Why? Because once in awhile you buy a gem that is in a league all its own-- twice as good as nearly everything you've ever rated 5 Stars. ELAYNE BOOSLER'S &#34;TIMELESS&#34; deserves 10 Stars.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this Box Set the week it went on sale. Why?  I grew up in the 1980s. I remember Elayne's curiously interesting take on the world-- not to mention her interestingly curly hair. Yes, she had the coolest hair in comedy (no joke!). One could say that was her trademark, but they'd be wrong. Her trademark was her wit; her indelible sense of humor and sense of self. You cannot be this funny, 100% of the time, without being true to yourself. Elayne's take on the world was, and still is, fascinating. She is so innately humorous--she WAS born to be on Broadway. What an entertainer!<br /><br />I remember being in my parents house watching the skit where she shook all over like her dog. That skit has been ingrained in my brain for 30 years. Yes, George Carlin would do an almost identical skit years later, but I love Carlin, so I hoped Elayne took it as flattery. (Who didn't bite off of Elayne's original brand of comedy?  'Don't want to mention names here,  but I can tell you, there would be no MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL had there been no Boosler PARTY OF ONE and TOP TOMATA.)<br /><br />TIMELESS comes with four TV specials plus one new live set (audio only-- but I guarantee, the skit she does where she's a baseball announcer throwing  advertisements in between every other word while giving the play-by- play of a guy at bat, is worth the price of the entire box set alone! I laughed so hard I almost choked.)<br /><br />There's no more apt a title than TIMELESS.<br />Elayne's comedy is as relevant and fresh as it was 30 some years ago-- and WITHOUT the gratuitous cursing and ""I'm not smart enough to write good jokes so I'll just stand up here and talk foul mouthed for an hour& a half"" nonsense we see and hear too often today. Yes, there's some cursing and relationship issues, safe sex, & condoms are discussed in Broadway Baby, but those subjects were relevant at the time due to AIDS; they're still relevant today.<br /><br />Elayne's comedy is smart.<br />It's hysterical.<br />It's timeless.<br />And if you don't laugh by the time she finishes singing the National Anthem at the end of the fourth special, you might want to check your pulse. 😉"

Was super excited to have this item in my collection! The movie was amazing which you must know if you’re looking at this. And the Dino’s that come with the gift set are perfect! I really want to take them out of the box but I’m keeping them in due to being a collectors item. I guess my the only complaint I sorta have is that it claims to be limited edition but it can’t be that limited since I bought this back in 2016 and yet they are still selling them so 🤷‍♀️ Either way if you’re a Jurassic Park lover like I am I recommend buying the set it’s worth it

"I have been to see Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s twice at the movies. Once during a field trip with the third graders from my children’s public school and the second time with my own family.  I can't wait to buy the DVD once it is released. There have been only a handful of movies [inlc. most of Aardman Animations and all of Laika’s films] that have created in my children the same enthusiasm as in me…add to this rare list this year’s Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s! My kids and I have fallen in equal amount of love with Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s! We simply ADORE this beautiful, clever, progressive visual adaptation of Carol Lewis’ sequel to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.  The first time I watched this movie was during a matinée at AMC Loews 84th Street 6 with hundreds of NYC public school children cheering and clapping enthusiastically for Alice and the Mad Hatter. Film reviewers ought to watch family movies with these kids for the sake of enlightenment. In Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s, Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter is the sweetest, gentlest, most original man to grace the silver screen in recent years. We LOVE his sweet lisp: “my fammelli,” his kind, caring, bold heart and his beautiful friendship with Alice and the wonderland creatures. I still marvel at Johnny Depp’s choice to give up the lure of being a pretty Hollywood mannequin for the sake of playing far riskier, playful, dark comedic roles. His work with Tim Burton is the stuff of legends. Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen is flawless, her every facial expression priceless, plus it is so good to see her character redeemed (blame her stingy mother!). Mia Wasikowska in the role of Alice is a breath of fresh air, a wonderful role model and guiding light for young girls and actresses the world over. Her aspirations not to mention her gorgeous wardrobe as Alice is to die for. Anne Hathaway is cleverly self-deprecating as the White Queen. There is a lot of great acting and world-class voice talent (Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall, and Barbara Windsor among others) representing the best of British comedy in Alice through the Looking Glass. The brilliant Welsh comedian Rhys Ifans in the role of Zanik Hightopp, the Mad Hatter’s father reminds me of Lionel Jeffries who played the father of Dick van Dyke’s character Caractacus Potts in the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Like Lionel Jeffries, Rhys Ifans too is younger than his on-screen son Johnny Depp. Leo Bill as Hamish is a younger, dorkier David Tomlinson as George Banks in the 1964 Mary Poppins film. Last but not least the British funnyman Matt Lucas’ dialogues as Tweedledum and Tweedledee with Alice are unforgettable:<br /><br />Alice: “What’s the matter?”<br /><br />White Rabbit: “The Hatter’s the matter.”<br /><br />Tweedledee: “Or the matter of the Hatter.”<br /><br />Tweedledum: “The former.”<br /><br />Tweedledee: “No, the latter.”<br /><br />Tweedledee: “[in unison with Tweedledum] He’s mad.”<br /><br />Alice: “The Hatter?”<br /><br />[the Tweedles nod]<br /><br />Alice: “Yes, I know…That’s his muchness. That’s what makes him so… him.”<br /><br />Tweedledee: “But he’s grown darker. Less dafter.”<br /><br />Tweedledum: “Denies himself laughter.”<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen as “Time” shows he can be funny without his jokes being on millions of Arabs and Muslims. Yet it seems that he still needs to ethnicize his characters. In the role of “Time,” he sports a post-WWII villainous German accent in scenes where “Time” is machine-like (read authoritarian) and switches to his notorious South London Pakistani “Ali G” accent when “Time” appears idiotic. Like in following scene when the joke is on “Time”:<br /><br />Mad Hatter: “[to Time] Is it true that you heal all wounds?”<br /><br />March Hare: “[sits next to Time and elbows him] Time is on my side!”<br /><br />Mad Hatter: “Why is it that you wait for no man?”<br /><br />Mallymkun: “[covers one eye] I just can’t find the time!”<br /><br />Mallymkun: “Cheshire! Where have you been? You’re late.”<br /><br />Cheshire Cat: “[lands on Time’s shoulders] Actually, I’m right on time.”<br /><br />Mad Hatter: [grabs Time’s hand] “I have time on my hand!”<br /><br />Time: “[in an Ali G. accent] You silly nitwits really think that I’ve not heard these cheap jabs before? Your attempts at mockery fall flat.”<br /><br />Mad Hatter: “[plays with Time’s shoulder pads] Look! Time is flying!”<br /><br />Time: “[stands up furiously] Enough! No more wasting me!”<br /><br />Mad Hatter: “[nervously] I’m having the time of my life?”<br /><br />It remains to be seen if Mr. Baron Cohen can stay in the game without being a pathological racist, although judging from his current Facebook profile picture, where his 4 million fans see him grinning in a plain white Arab keffiyeh and dishdasha standing next to an unsuspecting Saudi-looking man, I doubt this very much.<br /><br />The greatest credit for this beautiful film, dedicated to the brilliant late Alan Rickman (voice of Absolem) has got to go the heroic script-writer Linda Woolverton and producer Tim Burton the Magnificent, the author of so many of our dreams. Watch Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s, buy the DVD…it will delight you, it will! 📽"
"I have been to see Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s twice at the movies. Once during a field trip with the third graders from my children’s public school and the second time with my own family.  I can't wait to buy the DVD once it is released. There have been only a handful of movies [inlc. most of Aardman Animations and all of Laika’s films] that have created in my children the same enthusiasm as in me…add to this rare list this year’s Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s! My kids and I have fallen in equal amount of love with Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s! We simply ADORE this beautiful, clever, progressive visual adaptation of Carol Lewis’ sequel to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.  The first time I watched this movie was during a matinée at AMC Loews 84th Street 6 with hundreds of NYC public school children cheering and clapping enthusiastically for Alice and the Mad Hatter. Film reviewers ought to watch family movies with these kids for the sake of enlightenment. In Alice Through the Looking Gl͏a͏s͏s, Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter is the sweetest, gentlest, most original man to grace the silver screen in recent years. We LOVE his sweet lisp: “my fammelli,” his kind, caring, bold heart and his beautiful friendship with Alice and the wonderland creatures. I still marvel at Johnny Depp’s choice to give up the lure of being a pretty Hollywood mannequin for the sake of playing far riskier, playful, dark comedic roles. His work with Tim Burton is the stuff of legends. Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen is flawless, her every facial expression priceless, plus it is so good to see her character redeemed (blame her stingy mother!). Mia Wasikowska in the role of Alice is a breath of fresh air, a wonderful role model and guiding light for young girls and actresses the world over. Her aspirations not to mention her gorgeous wardrobe as Alice is to die for. Anne Hathaway is cleverly self-deprecating as the White Queen. There is a lot of great acting and world-class voice talent (Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall, and Barbara Windsor among others) representing the best of British comedy in Alice through the Looking Glass. The brilliant Welsh comedian Rhys Ifans in the role of Zanik Hightopp, the Mad Hatter’s father reminds me of Lionel Jeffries who played the father of Dick van Dyke’s character Caractacus Potts in the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Like Lionel Jeffries, Rhys Ifans too is younger than his on-screen son Johnny Depp. Leo Bill as Hamish is a younger, dorkier David Tomlinson as George Banks in the 1964 Mary Poppins film. Last but not least the British funnyman Matt Lucas’ dialogues as Tweedledum and Tweedledee with Alice are unforgettable:<br /><br />Alice: “What’s the matter?”<br /><br />White Rabbit: “The Hatter’s the matter.”<br /><br />Tweedledee: “Or the matter of the Hatter.”<br /><br />Tweedledum: “The former.”<br /><br />Tweedledee: “No, the latter.”<br /><br />Tweedledee: “[in unison with Tweedledum] He’s mad.”<br /><br />Alice: “The Hatter?”<br /><br />[the Tweedles nod]<br /><br />Alice: “Yes, I know…That’s his muchness.

"You release in 3D, 4kHD whatever, and DVD, but you DO NOT release for purchase on Prime video??<br /><br />Some of us care about the environment, and have a DIGITAL LIBRARY, as not to produce more waste! I guarantee not everyone recycles, so you waste the cardboard, because I have seen my father with a tiny box that 1 DVD came in, for his fancy tv🙄.<br /><br />Here you are this GIANT COMPANY, that’s tearing down green space to build your warehouse’s, which I understand is great for communities, as you are bringing job opportunities, but you need to balance the scale, and think about your impact on the environment as well.........."

This was the second movie to see on my “after cancer treatment” list!! I was so freaking happy I got to see it!! The movie is my favorite of all time along with Spirited Away!<br /><br />This movie had all of the feels for me. Jason and the whole cast nailed it. I also bought the fantastic soundtrack!! Now I’m waiting for the blu Ray to come out!<br /><br />Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾

"Hokey!  I was expecting a beautiful high tech smash hit, but was disappointed with the quality of the film. It felt more like a 100% computer generated online avatar game than a movie.  I would not recommend it, nor would I buy it again. Willam Dafoe is a great actor, & I've enjoyed his long acting career, but this layout, format, & production was not worthy of his acting stature & talent. I only watched the entire film becuz he was in it, but the other actors didn't measure up...they were a lot corny & there were too many silly comments among them. 😕 jlp  P. S.<br />Lots of beautiful colors tho."

"This is 50’s Sci-Fi at its best and stars like Forrest Tucker gives this movie the kick in the hind quarters it needs.<br />The movie starts off with a mountain with a glowing cloud on it and three climbers, two on the side, one up above them looking around and finds something he loses his head over and ends up scaring his other two friends when they pull his headless body back up after it falls...&lt;cue music 🎶 and opening credits>...<br />The UK Version is called The Trollenberg Terror<br />The film itself is very well made and doesn’t reveal the big bad crawling eye until 3/4’s into the film but there is lots to do before that happens, men go through cloud, die, come back to kill girl with telepathic powers, who is considered a threat to the invaders and Forrest Tucker, who figures out a way to do away with the icky creatures once and for all.<br />Now this flick is definitely worthy of Blu-ray consideration, not only that but I would be curious to see what a remake of this movie would look like.<br />Not that I would ever abandon this gem of a movie but I hope someday before I shuffle off to the great beyond, this movie is considered for a remake with today’s technology, my only hope is, they don’t screw it up."

"At first The seems to hold accurate points in history. Costumes are on point along with the acting and story telling but a few scenes had me 🤔. They watered down one of Hamlet’s great soliloquies and brought an oedipus complex in Hamlet. This movie could have gotten top marks but it does fall flat. I give it a three here , but it’s a 3 1/3 for Glenn Close and Helena Bonham Carter. They shine in this film."

Great movie (script) BUT: advertisements prior to the movie is bad enough of an  example of corporate greedy BS but to praise  Blu-ray Tm disc’s & then show a movie with a substandard quality picture clarity is very laughable! (This flick:low 20’s mega Bits per Second ~ a quality bd rom = mid 30’s!) also at the beginning 1/3 of the movie the audio is out of sync with the lip movements! Other follies include: over six minutes of credits flashing across the screen at the start of the movie 👎

"I watched this movie the other day on the Hallmark Movie Channel.  The Signed, Sealed, Delivered movies are some of my favorite!  First off, they are just good, clean movies.  No strong language, sex, or violence.  They're the type of movies you can watch with your ten year old son or your 80 year old mother.  The main characters are quirky and likeable and complement each other very well.<br /><br />Each movie has a mystery which involves a piece of undelivered mail.  Sometimes the mail is a letter, or sometimes a package containing something else.  As in all of the movies, they start down the road to find who the package was sent to.  The road to find who a package was sent to is always interesting and leads to unexpected twists and turns.  There are always interesting historical facts that make the story line more interesting.  I've watched all of these movies and I always think I have the story figured out about halfway through....and each time I'm wrong 😊.....I end up surprised that it's totally different from what I initially thought.  Each movie has a good underlying moral teaching.  Heartbreaking issues are dealt with but they each end on an inspiring,  uplifting note.  You walk away feeling touched and inspired.  I absolutely love these movies and I recommend them to anyone....especially if you are looking for a good, clean, wholesome movie.  These are good movies to introduce to teenagers as well.  I hope Hallmark keeps reproducing these amazing Signed, Sealed, Delivered movies.....love, love, love them!!!"

"Okay... First off, I completely cannot understand the negative reviews here. It's almost as if customers were paid to write a crappy review on this film. More Hollywood politics, I guess!?! Anyway...The storyline is purely science fiction, well written and thought out. Butler is Superb in his role, as are the other supporting actors. I can't understand why people expect so much out of the actors. Do they want them to actually die on screen? WTF? These people did a fantastic job in portraying characters in a sci-fi movie! At least is isn't unbelievable drivel such as the latest installments in the Star Wars franchise! Yes! There are unbelievable moments, but by god, they are quite enjoyable moments. The CGI and effects are off the map! The pacing is wonderful. Why did this movie fail at the box office? Because people can't think for themselves. They would rather listen to movie critics than trust their own judgement. If you want continuous action and suspense, I highly suggest you buy this bluray, as this is undeniably one incredible science fiction movie! Thank you Dean Devlin...😸👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"

"⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I ordered from Amazon.com this title isn’t available in Canada which suits me fine I don’t like French on my cases but unfortunately the digital codes won’t work here either however ,I knew this before purchasing & it’s a sacrifice I was willing to make . I’m more then happy with this beautiful copy of Scream 2 delivered to me by Amazon logistics which is my first time having them deliver to my door WOW AMAZING way better then canadas Intelcom ! You can track the truck as they get closer just gotta keep checking for updates . I was able to go outside mins before he arrived showed driver my picture ID delivered! Success!! I LOVE this delivery service much better then Intelcom plz always use !! !! The scream 2 comes with a glossy slipcover the paint tends to flake off glossy covers as you can see silver spots on the slip they really could put more effort into making the slips & inserts more durable.  Also the case was missing one tab inside & it wasn’t even inside the case so clearly it was just defected. Not a big deal at all the case works fine. I’m not reviewing the movie enough people do this already I just wanted to review the physical aspect of film case cover etc. Looks great in my collection ! The plastic sleeve you see over top the slipcover is not included I put all my movies in plastic sleeves keeps em healthy. Thank you Amazon.com perfecto love it !! !! 👏"

"When I got the DVD I was really worried as the cover was barely better than a homemade one. As a matter of fact there's probably better DIY software to create your own DVD covers and labels available! So I put the DVD in to take a look. Immediately upon inserting the DVD into my player it went directly to play. When I tried to go to the menu screen, I got the old ""that function not allowed"" message. My hopes for the quality of this video did not improve any when I saw there was no menu screen whatsoever. When the video got to the intro. screen, it looked kind of blurred. By now I'm thinking this turkey was going back to Amazon! However I decided to wait and watch a few minutes of the movie itself and I was certainly glad that I did. Once the movie itself started I found the video quality to be razor sharp, the sound to be loud and clear, and the overall quality to be that of a ""digitally remastered/restored"" movie. As this particular movie is hard to find, I decided ""who cares about the cover art""! The one thing I do wish it had was closed captioning as I seemed to have developed some audio frequency hearing issues and tend to turn the CC on for that reason. That cost the rating one star. But all in all, this copy is quite watchable and we'll worth the reasonable cost!! 👍"
"When I got the DVD I was really worried as the cover was barely better than a homemade one. As a matter of fact there's probably better DIY software to create your own DVD covers and labels available! So I put the DVD in to take a look. Immediately upon inserting the DVD into my player it went directly to play. When I tried to go to the menu screen, I got the old ""that function not allowed"" message.

This is a really good movie with lots of twist and turns. It will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It has a really good plot and keeps you guessing. I would definitely recommend this movie. There is not really anything that I disliked about it. The plot moves along rather quickly before coming all together or reaching the climax.  I think I will go watch it again here shortly. 🥺😵

"Very enjoyable. A powerful plot!<br />But I thought several of the Villains were a little ‘low energy’.<br />A brief return to Jamaica, the real-life home of multi-talented Ian Fleming, where he wrote his 14 Spy adventures. The former MI6 operative had accomplished so much for his Homeland, the UK, before ‘retiring’ as a full-time writer, passing away young, at age 56.<br />Amazingly, according to UPI and numerous sources, he even helped to write the blueprint for our real-life CIA.<br />“The 72-page document is on display at London's Imperial War Museum.”<br />In the synopsis, “His perfect secret agent,” the Times of London said, ""must have trained powers of observation, analysis and evaluation; absolute discretion, sobriety, devotion to duty; language and wide experience, and be aged about 40 to 50.""<br />Daniel Craig is only 53. 🤗"

"Sorry, this film didn’t feel like a James Bond film at all. Too long, the villain was badly written and the ending was terrible. It felt more like a vanity project for actor Daniel Craig that anything else. Well, at least we have the better produced classics with Connery and Moore to enjoy!  (Spoiler alert!) The funniest part is seeing Bond crying like a baby before getting pulverized instead of trying to save himself! 😂😂😂"

I really really liked this movie because of the Venom character - I loved his deep voice with some comedy added in which I wasn’t expecting but was greatly surprised. This is not a scary movie like the previews led me to believe so it took me a very long time to finally rent it on dvd to watch & i’m so glad I did because it’s a definite “keeper” in my personal opinion👍

It wasn’t a cost affective solution for me, so I waisted my money!!  If ur mobile & wouldn’t be challenged…maybe it’ll work out for u🙏"

"Too which she said, ""Yes.""😊<br />I've yet to watch this DVD, without shedding a tear or two. But the tears are not angry or even sad tears. They just come. The movie is exceptional. It's as if, Denzel Washington transcends the role of Malcolm X and the cast feeds off him. Unbelievable. It's simply powerful. Angela Bassett's steady presence as Betty Shabazz, the wife of Malcolm X, is fantastic!! Then there's Spike Lee as 'Shorty.' Malcolm's hommie, and partner in crime, before cleaning up his life. Lee's role was entertaining. And what can we say about Albert Hall as Baines? Malcolm's fellow inmate who mentors and draws him to 'The Nation.?' Fine also is Teresa Randle as Laura, a younger Malcolm's, love interest. And Al Freeman Jr. as Elijah Muhammad, the leader of The Nation of Islam. He does very well. And many more good actors and actresses. There's even a cameo appearance by the late former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela! It's interesting, viewing this movie through the lenses of the YouTube documentary 'Make it Plain,' (Which is a play on words), is an eye opener to say the least. In that documentary, many celebrities, including Ossie Davis and others, speak of Malcolm X as man who cared about people. Also noteworthy, one Muslim said, that unlike others, ""minister Malcolm was honest."" After leaving 'The Nation,' that's how Malcolm X wanted to be introduced as he ascends a stage to speak. ""Just make it plain."" Thus, the title of the documentary, demonstrating some humility. This DVD is 201 minutes. It may make a fine addition to your movies collection."

"Was very excited to finally be able to see one of my all time favorite movies in full 4k HDR. I sent the first disc back thinking I just got a dud, but the replacement does the exact same thing. Scratchy, obnoxiously loud, distorted audio.<br />I have plenty of other 4k Blu-rays with 7.1 audio that work flawlessly, so it's definitely some defect of the discs, or fault of the studio for not including multiple audio formats. Such a bummer 😞"

DVD wouldn't play on DVD player I don't know if it's the format or what very very disappointing I wished I would've been warned 😔!!

Fantastic film. Restored my faith in humans. Great to see all those characters..both feline and human. 😁

Well apparently this is a PAL not an NTSC format so it will not work in any American DVD players. Took over a month to get here and I couldn’t ever watch it. Thanks for that 😑

"This movie is one of my favorites,  and also my husband loves it as well ( after I  finally talked him into watching it 😀)"

"This is a great remaster of the series! The colors pop and the audio was better than I expected. My only complaint for this release is that its pretty barebones. The main menu is really bland and the only special feature isnt enough to satisfy. All nitpicks aside, I highly reccomend this release of the series! The Opening is such a banger!!! 😤👌👌👌👌"
Got the Movie Blu-ray put it in and it said it won't play in the Player. Ridiculous. Seriously Lol<br /> Something wrong with it coming from somewhere in the US Amazon. I don't have a UK player. Wtf over. It should actually be no stars. Two thumbs down very disappointed.<br />Paddy O'Carroll Irish/American Prince Charles owes me money 💰
